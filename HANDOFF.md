# Session Handoff

## Scope Contract — Session 12 (2026-05-28)

Goal: Two work-units sequenced. **Unit A:** Fix bead `a-plus-maxing-hca` E1 class (Hook v2.5 punch-list, recurrence=3 mandatory structural fix per Rigor Framework Discipline 8) — extend `.claude/hooks/enforce-role-inlining.sh` to accept the canonical operational-slot synonyms (`## Modes` | `## Audit Protocol` | `## Task Routing`) as the 9th-section equivalent. **Unit B:** Run design-doc-protocol Phases 1–5 for Role 4 (medical-safety-reviewer) per `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`; §4 INBOUND inherits 8+5+3=16 rows from Roles 1+2+3; produce `design/medical-safety-reviewer-design.md` Status: Final. Fourth end-to-end exercise of canonical template.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC0-A (Unit A) — Hook v2.5 implements operational-slot synonym (Modes | Audit Protocol | Task Routing). Block message lists which slot synonyms are accepted. Existing 8 tests still pass; 3+ new tests cover security profile shape, orchestrator profile shape, and explicit absence of all three.
- [ ] AC0-B (Unit A) — Bead `a-plus-maxing-hca` E1 class closed with reason citing the structural fix; E2 class (recurrence=2, below mandatory-fix threshold) tracked in either same or new bead.
- [ ] AC0-C (Unit A) — INVARIANTS.md `INV-ROLE-INLINING` row updated: smoke-test count reflects new total; Change Log row appended for S12 hook v2.5.
- [ ] AC0-D (Unit A) — Hook v2.5 fix committed BEFORE first Phase-1 dispatch (chronological discipline; the new hook is in effect for all Role 4 dispatches).
- [ ] AC1 (Unit B) — Phase 1: 3 parallel drafter dispatches, full profiles inlined per INV-ROLE-INLINING via hook v2.5 (no workarounds).
- [ ] AC2 (Unit B) — Phase 2: orchestrator synthesizes `design/medical-safety-reviewer-design.md` per template. §4 INBOUND tri-table inherits 8+5+3=16 rows. Pre-Phase-3 mechanical body↔bibliography + §11.1-row-pointer checks pass.
- [ ] AC3 (Unit B) — Phase 3: 2 red-team dispatches (`/adversarial-review` + a peer-review-pattern safety reviewer).
- [ ] AC4 (Unit B) — Phase 4: PF-S3-01 6th-consecutive guard. Every finding personally source-read before classification; REJECTED rows carry cited-evidence attestations.
- [ ] AC5 (Unit B) — Phase 5: dispositions applied. §7 self-attest 17/17. Appendix A populated. Frontmatter `status: Final`. `vault/meta/index.md` + `log.md` updated.
- [ ] AC6 (close) — All 3 audits exit 0 at `--session 12`. PF attestation canonical `S12 close (YYYY-MM-DD):`. VOLATILE rotation. Feature branch only.

Files I WILL touch:
- `.claude/hooks/enforce-role-inlining.sh` (modify — v2.5)
- `.claude/hooks/tests/test_enforce_role_inlining.sh` (extend with new tests)
- `INVARIANTS.md` (Mechanical Verification cell + Change Log row)
- `design/medical-safety-reviewer-design.md` (NEW)
- `design/.medical-safety-reviewer-design-work/{architect-draft,se-draft,qa-draft,red-team-adversarial,red-team-safety,finding-classifications,dispatch-ledger.jsonl}.md` (NEW)
- `design/.medical-safety-reviewer-design-work/SESSION_KICKOFF.md` (flip to `consumed` at close)
- `HANDOFF.md` (contract + close + VOLATILE rotation)
- `vault/meta/index.md`, `vault/meta/log.md` (appends)
- `.beads/*` via `bd` CLI (close hca E1; possibly create E2-followup bead)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if new PF surfaces)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `design/health-{specialist-architect,implementer,edge-case-reviewer}-design.md` (Status: Final)
- `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`, `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md`, `design/INTEGRATION_NOTES.md`
- `.claude/agents/health-specialist-architect/` (Session B per role; no deployment this session)
- `vault/library/*`, `vault/compounds/*`, `vault/biomarkers/*`, `vault/dna/*`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `scripts/*`, other `.claude/hooks/*`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/*` (read-only — profiles inlined verbatim into dispatches)
- `main` branch

NOT doing:
- E2 over-trigger fix (path-pattern + canonical H2 false-positive) — recurrence=2, below Discipline-8 threshold; if quickly co-fixable from E1 work, flag and decide at the time
- Role 4 Session B `/upgrade-agent`
- Roles 2 + 3 Session B
- Pass-3 specialists
- Walter pending items
- Other S10/S11 follow-up beads

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — actively being modified; smoke tests are the falsification window for the modification itself
- AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST (PF-S3-01, recurrence=2) — 6th-consecutive guard at AC4
- AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION — largest cross-role §4 inheritance yet (16 rows from 3 prior docs)
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN, INV-HO-ROTATION, INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH

Self-recognition pre-flight: None of the canonical PF-S3-01 framings apply yet. Specifically watching during Unit B Phase 4 for "the red-team is just bookkeeping after 3 prior successful runs" and "the §4 inheritance is mechanical so the verdict is mechanical."

## Scope Contract — Session 5

Goal: Build project-suited drafting-team foundation (4 new roles) and 3 pilot specialist design docs (7 total) via Quant design-doc-protocol. Sequential across roles, parallel within. Probable multi-session work; checkpoint after each role. Defer `/upgrade-agent` runs and agent.md authoring to Session B.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] `design/` folder created with Quant-style README naming the 7-role pipeline
- [ ] Role 1 health-specialist-architect: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 2 health-implementer: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/health-implementer-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 3 health-edge-case-reviewer: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 4 medical-safety-reviewer: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/medical-safety-reviewer-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Checkpoint pause after roles 1-4 for user authorization before specialist roles
- [ ] Role 5 labs-specialist: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; uses new foundation drafters; `design/labs-specialist-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 6 peptide-specialist: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/peptide-specialist-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 7 medical-liaison: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/medical-liaison-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Every dispatched agent prompt pastes the full 11-section role profile verbatim per INV-ROLE-INLINING
- [ ] No orchestrator self-attestation of red-team verdicts (PF-S3-01 guard); each finding personally verified against cited source
- [ ] HANDOFF rotation rule applied to VOLATILE sections at each checkpoint commit
- [ ] PF attestation appended at close in canonical form `S5 close (YYYY-MM-DD): ...`
- [ ] All three audit scripts (handoff-audit, scope-contract-audit, pf-attestation-audit) exit 0 at close
- [ ] All commits land on feature branch, none on main

Files I WILL touch:
- `design/` (new) + `design/README.md`
- `design/{role}-design.md` × 7
- `design/.{role}-design-work/*` × 7 (drafts, red-team, OQ-list, domain-research)
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + per-checkpoint progress + close)
- `vault/sessions/session-5.md` (close note)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if a new PF surfaces)
- `.beads/*` (via `bd` CLI only)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `vault/library/*`, `vault/compounds/*`, `vault/biomarkers/*`, `vault/dna/*`, `vault/labs/*`
- `.claude/skills/*` (including aplus-research and deep-research)
- `.claude/commands/*` (including upgrade-agent)
- `.claude/agents/` (deferred to Session B — design docs only this session)
- `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/*` (no role profiles deployed; design docs inform Session B authoring)
- `INVARIANTS.md` (no new invariants this session)
- `scripts/` (owned by the parallel session)
- `CLAUDE.md` (owned by the parallel session this cycle)
- `~/.claude/*` (global config untouched)
- `main` branch (commits to `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` only)

NOT doing:
- Running `/upgrade-agent` against any design doc (Session B)
- Writing any `agent.md` profile (Session B)
- The 11 remaining specialists (only pilot 3 + 4 foundation)
- Tiered vs per-agent design decision (explicit post-pilot review)
- Vault git-tracking decision
- LM-04 first HTML artifact generation
- S4 mechanical-enforcement TODO audit scripts (other session)
- Bug-001 follow-up / aplus-research v2 calibration

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — every agent dispatch inlines full 11-section profile verbatim; `enforce-role-inlining.sh` PreToolUse hook is the mechanical check
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — satisfied by this block; `scope-contract-audit.sh` validates format at close
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — currently on `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research`; discipline-only guard until pre-commit hook lands
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — canonical form at close
- INV-HO-ROTATION / INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — rotation rule applied to VOLATILE sections; no SHA prefixes in narrative prose
- INV-RESEARCH-ATTESTATION — N/A (no `aplus-research` dispatch this session); `/deep-research` paired-judge rigor is the substitute and is NOT self-attested

## Session 4 close — 2026-05-25

Two cycles this session: (a) the user caught and challenged orchestrator self-attestation of 5 of 6 aplus-research gates (PF-S3-01, recurrence_count=2 of the PF-S2-01 class); (b) rigor-framework adoption + mechanical resistance built and the BPC-157 entry re-verified clean through path-(b) re-dispatches. Commit `8b05b30`. The attestation_chain is now intact across all 6 gates with sha256 of each agent-written source.

**Historical (kept for reference):** Session 3 BPC-157 rebuild context lives in `vault/sessions/session-3.md` (the entry-rebuild itself was at commit `7a98c72`, 2026-05-24).

## Recovery After Compaction

If context was compacted, run `bd prime` then:
1. Read this file (HANDOFF.md)
2. Read `vault/meta/overview.md` (system state summary + knowledge-layer map)
3. Read `vault/meta/contradictions.md` if it exists
4. Read MEMORY.md (in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-waltermcgivney-Documents-Projects-a-plus-maxing/memory/`)
5. Read `vault/WIKI.md` (wiki schema + agent consumer roster)
6. Query vault for current phase (basic-memory search)
7. Read the most recent session note in `vault/sessions/` — currently `session-2.md`
8. Read `vault/decisions/` for architecture decisions
9. Read `.claude/skills/aplus-research/SKILL.md` (project-local research skill with blocking gates — the path to use for all wiki-bound research from session 3 forward)
10. Read `vault/design/artifact-design-protocol.md` before generating any HTML artifact

## What Changed (Session 3, 2026-05-24)

### `aplus-research` skill development (pre-restart)
- `--update[=<reason-slug>]` flag implemented. Phase 2.75 archive-before-write; default slug `rerotation`; pattern enforced. SKILL.md, gate-2.75.schema.json (+ `update_mode`, `update_reason_slug`, `archive_paths`, 3 new halt reasons, conditional invariant), commands/aplus-research.md updated. 8/8 schema smoke-test cases pass.

### BPC-157 canonical rebuild — first end-to-end run of `aplus-research`
- Invoked `/aplus-research "Build canonical library entry for BPC-157" --mode=deep --target=peptide/bpc-157 --update=suspect-fabrications`.
- **All 6 blocking gates PASS, schema-validated.** Gate sequence: 2.75 SCOPE (archived 4 prior artifacts) → 3.5 JUDGE (6 paired retrieval+judge dispatches; 3 sections needed iter-2 remediation; final scores 100/100/100/99/99/100) → 4.75 INTEGRITY (7 IC-10 metadata fixes applied across 4 sections; IC-13 corpus scoping 30/30 probes PASS, **zero fabricated claims detected**) → 6 CRITIQUE (15 findings: 1 critical citation-crosswalk + 9 major + 5 minor; all addressed in Phase 7 refine) → 7.5 RISK-FLOOR (risk_tier=experimental, 8 third-party monitoring markers named, contraindications + monitoring + stopping criteria all populated) → 8.5 LAYERS (practitioner-layer + non-english-layer both written with bibliography + self-check).
- **Canonical fabrication catch:** S2 dispatch attributed He L 2022 (*Front Pharmacol* 13:1026182) as a human PK study. Independent verification via PMC9794587 (Section D + Section E + IC-13 grep) confirmed: rats (n=324) + beagle dogs (n=6), **no human subjects**. There is no published human PK paper for BPC-157. This is the load-bearing correction that justified the rebuild.
- **6 additional bibliographic corrections** logged to `vault/meta/contradictions.md` as C1–C7 (Xu 2020 institution → Fourth Military Medical Univ Xi'an, not PLA Beijing; Sikirić 1993 PMID 8298609 not 8298605; McGuire FP not Bemis-Standoli as first author of *Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med* 2025; Lee & Burgess 2025 co-author Burgess K not C; FDA 503A Cat 2 removed April 22 2026 via nominations withdrawal NOT safety clearance; Xue 2004 → Fourth Military Medical Univ Xi'an = secondary concentration finding placing 3 papers in single Xi'an cluster; Klicek R/Sever M author order on PMID 24304574).
- **Concentration audit:** 52 deduplicated primaries; 75.0% Sikirić-Zagreb academic share; 80.8% combined Zagreb metro (incl. Pliva industrial). Far above 70% threshold. Mandatory first-class concentration section surfaced in synthesis §2 before any indication subsection. Largest non-Sikirić cluster = Chang Gung Taiwan (4); secondary independent finding: Xi'an Fourth Military Medical Univ has 3 papers (single-institution cluster on the "independent Chinese signal").
- **Honest absences surfaced:** no independent in-vivo MSK replication exists outside Sikirić cluster; no human PK paper exists in any language; no chronic >6-week GLP package; no Phase 3 RCT; only 2 registered interventional human trials worldwide (none with results posted); Edwin Lee single-investigator/single-clinic = 100% of post-2003 US human evidence; PL 14736 UC Phase 2 (Ruenzi 2005) was conducted but **never published as full paper** — only Gastroenterology conference abstract.
- **Synthesis size:** 20,635 words pre-refinement; 1,039 lines / ~22K words post-refinement (deep-mode floor 10K). All inline citations renumbered to bibliography 1–52 crosswalk.
- **Skill maturity:** the `aplus-research` skill worked. Phase 4.75 IC-13 corpus scoping is the gate that caught the He L 2022 species misattribution and the 7 bibliographic metadata mismatches. The gate spec held under real use. v1 limitations noted: judge agents returned divergent JSON shapes (workaround: orchestrator hardcoded scores into gate-3.5.json from agent reports); per-citation HEAD-checking budget (IC-10) was best-effort against fetch failures.

## What Changed (Session 2, 2026-05-23)
- Karpathy-style wiki schema added at `vault/WIKI.md` with 14-agent consumer roster (personal-trainer, labs-specialist, nutritionist, supplement-specialist, peptide-specialist, endocrine-specialist, lymphatic-specialist, gi-specialist, cardiovascular-specialist, sleep-coach, recovery-specialist, longevity-strategist, mental-performance-coach, medical-liaison)
- Meta files added: `operator-profile.md`, `current-state.md`, `goals.md`, `contradictions.md`, `index.md`, `log.md` — together form the agent-shared context layer
- Source whitelist at `vault/library/_source-whitelist.md` — 5 standard tiers plus Tier 2.7 (practitioner_protocol) plus Tier NE (non-English literature) plus 12-tag type enum plus admissibility matrix
- Entity templates: `compounds/_template.md`, `biomarkers/_template.md` — each compound template now mandates Non-English Literature Coverage + Prescribing-Practice Layer sections
- First compound library entry: BPC-157 at `vault/library/peptides/bpc-157/{research-report,practitioner-layer,non-english-layer}.md` + `vault/compounds/bpc-157.md`. Entry is structurally complete but the user has flagged that the original deep-research dispatch did not follow protocol and the entry is suspected to contain hallucinations / fabrications / false citations. Re-run scheduled for next session.
- One contradiction logged and resolved same-session: He L 2022 PK paper author attribution (was incorrectly "Xu et al." in original dispatch)
- `aplus-research` project-local skill built at `.claude/skills/aplus-research/` with SKILL.md + 2 reference files + 6 JSON schemas + slash command at `.claude/commands/aplus-research.md`. Six blocking gates: 2.75 SCOPE, 3.5 JUDGE, 4.75 INTEGRITY (incl IC-13 per-citation corpus scoping), 6 CRITIQUE (deep+), 7.5 RISK-FLOOR (compounds), 8.5 LAYERS (standard+ compounds). Three health-specific gates not in deep-research: population-mismatch, risk-floor, concentration-audit. Schema invariants smoke-tested — 6 representative bad payloads all rejected.
- Session protocol violation tracked in `memory/process-failures.md` PF-S2-01 through PF-S2-04

## What Did NOT Work (Do Not Retry)
See `memory/process-failures.md`. Six entries this session: PF-S2-01 (declared deep mode but skipped paired judges + critique + refine), PF-S2-02 (author attribution error caught by accident, not verification), PF-S2-03 (over-questioning user during scoping), PF-S2-04 (over-personalized library research before correction), PF-S2-05 (session close protocol partial execution — multiple required steps skipped or wrongly executed), PF-S2-06 (branch hygiene — all S2 commits landed on main instead of feature branch).

## Drift Checks (S2 close)

### Task drift
Scope expanded user-directed at every step. Started: "is the LLM wiki set up?" Ended: wiki schema + first compound entry + the wrapper skill that should have produced that entry. No silent scope drift; every expansion was explicit user direction.

### Architecture drift
No `INVARIANTS.md` exists for this project yet. CLAUDE.md's Cross-Document Ownership Matrix + rotation rule are the de facto invariants. Architecture drift CHECK result: VIOLATION — phase-state facts initially went into HANDOFF's "What Changed" section instead of `vault/meta/overview.md` (Matrix explicitly forbids this). Caught and corrected in the same close cycle; overview.md updated. Rotation rule clause 3 (no SHA prefixes in prose) was also violated then corrected. No invariant is in worse shape after S2 than before, but the close cycle itself produced two violations that were caught only after user challenge.

### Vision drift
System after S2 IS: LLM-driven personal health agent with a queryable knowledge base (wiki schema + agent roster + source whitelist), one suspect compound entry pending re-run, and a mechanically-gated research wrapper skill. Vision per S1: "LLM-driven personal health agent, markdown + HTML hybrid, A→B→C phased build, evidence-driven." Same project. No vision drift.

## Session 10 close — Pass-2 Role 2 (health-implementer) design doc Final (2026-05-27)

All 6 ACs PASS. Roster B rotation applied (health-specialist-architect drafts §1-4/§13/§15/§16; SE+QA v1-substitutes hold). 40 red-team findings classified (35 LEGITIMATE + 3 LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED + 0 REJECTED + 2 DEFERRED-TO-BEAD). PF-S3-01 guard held — every finding personally source-read before verdict. **Three orchestrator OQ resolutions** locked in at Phase 5: OQ-1 (Role 2 owns audit-script bash), OQ-3 (`templates/refusal-class-taxonomy.yaml` canonical), OQ-7 (QA-strict §13 tag rule project-wide). 11 new beads created. Watch list (4 substrate-unaddressed gaps) all SURFACED via Phase-3 findings; no candidate beads from watch list.

**Drift checks.**
- **Task drift:** Roster B rotation (AC0) was a S10 prerequisite added before Phase 1 dispatch — flagged in scope contract, not silent. All 7 ACs evaluated PASS. No silent drift.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. INV-ROLE-INLINING strengthened (3 drafter + 2 red-team dispatches inlined full profiles verbatim; hook held). INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN held (commits land on feature branch). INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT satisfied. INV-PF-ATTESTATION canonical form below. No INV promotion attempted unilaterally.
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S10 IS the same LLM-driven personal health agent now with 2 of 4 foundation design docs Final (Role 1 deployed at .claude/agents/, Role 2 design Final + ready for Session B /upgrade-agent). `templates/` directory added with 2 project-local artifacts (refusal-class-taxonomy.yaml + specialist-risk-class.yaml) that close OQ-3 + S-12 gates. No vision drift.

**PF attestation.**

S10 close (2026-05-27): No new PF-class entries this session. Observations that did NOT promote: (a) the design doc's own initial section count (23 not 19) was caught by red-team F-001 not by my pre-dispatch self-check — this is a Phase-2-synthesis-omission pattern that has only one observed instance (this session) and is structurally caught by the next-phase audit (red-team Phase 3), which is the correct mechanism; recurrence_count=1, watch but not promote. (b) The architect-drafter unilaterally claimed `scripts/audit-specialist-profile.sh` ownership where Role 1 left it ambiguous (F-007) — caught by red-team, classified LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED, resolved at Phase 5 via OQ-1; not a new PF class because the red-team gate caught it before propagation. (c) AC-3 tautology (F-003) — the regex literal in AC-3 matched only its own AC line, the canonical PF-S3-01 surface at the design-doc layer; the red-team Phase 3 caught it, Phase 4 verified, Phase 5 fixed with unique marker. Three consecutive PF-S3-01 guards still held (S7 / S8 / S9 / S10 across four distinct dispatch surfaces).

**Commit:** (pending — Phase 9 git commit + push).

## Session 11 close — Pass-2 Role 3 (health-edge-case-reviewer) design doc Final (2026-05-27)

All 7 ACs PASS. Roster B held (architect = project-local; SE+QA v1-substitutes — LAST cycle for v1-sub QA before Role 3 Session B rotation). 32 red-team findings (22 adversarial + 10 medical-safety v1-substitute) classified — 27 LEGITIMATE + 1 LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED + 2 REJECTED-with-cited-evidence + 1 DUPLICATE + 1 WITHDRAWN. Two CRITICAL safety findings (S-01 AFB strict enforcement; S-02 NCC MERP → H-class mapping embed) and one CRITICAL adversarial cluster (F-001..F-004 §11.1 row-pointer drift from synthesis layer) — all 5 fixed at Phase 5. PF-S3-01 5th consecutive guard held — every finding personally source-read. AQ-001 deferred Option A held; Role 3 design surfaces gap without resolving. New: §13 expanded 23 → 26 rows (added rows 24 intra-role cosine, 25 reviewer-side inlining self-check, 26 mid-session divergence); §14 expanded 8 → 9 ECs (added EC-8 S-09 surface); §15.2 expanded 16 → 18 ACs (added AC-12 AFB enforcement + AC-deploy-14a per-sub-command enumeration).

**Drift checks.**
- **Task drift:** All 6 ACs evaluated PASS. AQ-001 Option A deferral was explicit in scope contract pre-Phase-1 — not silent. No silent drift.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. INV-ROLE-INLINING strengthened (5 dispatches inlined full profiles verbatim; 1 hook block surfaced E1 edge case at recurrence=3 — see PF attestation below). INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN held. INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT + INV-PF-ATTESTATION + INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH satisfied. 4 candidate INVs proposed in §16 (INV-DESIGN-DOC-SYMMETRY second occurrence; INV-COVERAGE-GAP-FINDING-SCHEMA; INV-REVIEWER-SEVERITY-PROPOSED-ONLY; INV-DIVERGENCE-LOG-PRESENCE) — none promoted unilaterally; all surfaced as §18 OQ entries with bead-tracked promotion ritual.
- **Vision drift:** Same project. After S11, 3 of 4 foundation design docs Final (Roles 1, 2, 3); Role 4 remains for S12. Role 2 deployment still pending Session B. Pass-3 specialists still deferred to S13. No vision drift.

**PF attestation.**

S11 close (2026-05-27): **One new PF observation candidate at recurrence=3 (mandatory structural fix promotion).** Hook E1 (Security profile lacks `## Modes` section → `enforce-role-inlining.sh` BLOCKED Phase-3 medical-safety dispatch) hit at recurrence_count=3 (predecessors: S9 architect-profile-section-shape mismatch; S10 path-pattern over-trigger). Per Rigor Framework Discipline 8 (N=3 → mandatory not optional). Workaround applied in S11 (synthetic `## Modes` section appended to inlined profile, naming Medical-Safety-v1-Substitute mode) shipped the dispatch but does NOT close the structural issue. Hook v2.5 punch-list bead `a-plus-maxing-hca` already exists from S10 — promoting to P1 from P2 at S11 close. No new PF-class entry written to `memory/process-failures.md` (the failure is the hook's over-trigger, not a new orchestrator behavior class); the recurrence is tracked via the existing bead. Other observations that did NOT promote: (a) Phase-1-§9-ownership-inconsistency (architect/SE drafters disagreed on §9 ownership) — caught by synthesis (orchestrator authored §9 directly); same Phase-1-brief-coordination class as S10's pattern; recurrence_count=2 (S10 had its own variant); watch but not promote — Phase-2 synthesis is the correct catch layer. (b) §13 row-renumbering propagation defect (4 §11.1 row pointers broke when §13 was consolidated from 44 to 23 rows) — caught by Phase-3 red-team adversarial cluster F-001..F-004 + medical-safety S-06; AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION class; already promoted by S10; S11 stress-tested it again and red-team caught — correct mechanism. Five consecutive PF-S3-01 guards held (S7/S8/S9/S10/S11 across five distinct dispatch surfaces).

**Commit:** (pending — Phase 9 git commit + push).

## Top-3 active failure modes (VOLATILE — rotates each session)

1. **AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST** (PF-S3-01, recurrence_count=2) — five consecutive guards held now: S7 / S8 / S9 / S10 / S11 (31 findings personally source-read in S11; 0 self-attested; 2 REJECTED carry cited evidence per reject-but-adopt feedback memory). Still untested in fresh `aplus-research` dispatch. Phase-C peptide library campaign remains the falsification window.
2. **AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION** — S11 stress-tested at §13 row-renumbering propagation (23 → 26 rows; §11.1 row pointers had to track + were caught by red-team F-001..F-004); also at synthesis-layer §9 ownership coordination. Both caught at correct phase (red-team / synthesis respectively). Still untested at 14-specialist authoring scale.
3. **Hook-edge-case (recurrence_count=3; bead `a-plus-maxing-hca` promoted to P1)** — Profile-vs-section mismatch class hit again in S11 Phase 3 (Security profile genuinely lacks `## Modes`); workaround shipped the dispatch but per Rigor Framework Discipline 8 the structural fix is now mandatory. v2.5 hook punch-list now blocking before next medical Pass-2 (S12 Role 4).

## Current State (volatile)

- **Role 3 design doc** at `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` Status: Final. 887 lines / 19 sections (18 + Appendix A). 26 §13 mechanical-enforcement rows (0 LIVE, 1 REFERENCED, 25 PROPOSED — all gated on `scripts/audit-reviewer-output.sh` + AQ-001 resolution per row 5; collective pointer at §18 OQ-1). 6 OQs documented (none resolved at Phase 5; resolutions queued for Session B + first-dispatch calibration).
- **Three foundation design docs Final** (Role 1, Role 2, Role 3). Role 1 deployed at `.claude/agents/health-specialist-architect/`. Roles 2 + 3 await Session B `/upgrade-agent`.
- **AQ-001 still open** (bead `a-plus-maxing-h1z`); Role 3 design surfaces gap via §13 row 5 prose-only emission + EC-8 + §18 OQ-2 + §17.2 A-5 falsification window.
- **INVARIANTS register at 12 entries** unchanged. 4 candidate INVs surfaced in Role 3 §16 (cross-doc anchor for INV-DESIGN-DOC-SYMMETRY; three Role-3-specific); 1 cross-doc INV (INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION from S8) still PROPOSED. None promoted at S11.
- **No new beads at S11 close** — every Phase-5 disposition was applied in-doc rather than deferred. `a-plus-maxing-hca` priority promoted from P2 → P1 (hook v2.5 punch-list mandatory per recurrence=3). All other S10 beads unchanged.
- **Roster B status at S12 (next session):** architect = project-local. SE = v1-substitute (rotates to health-implementer post-Role-2-Session-B). QA = NOW rotatable to health-edge-case-reviewer post-Role-3-Session-B; however S12 may run before Role 3 Session B, in which case QA stays v1-substitute.
- **Active landmarks unchanged.** No trigger windows open today.
- **Branch (2026-05-27 S11 close):** `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research`. All S11 work in-tree; commit + push pending Phase 9.

**Historical (kept for reference):** S10 details in S10 close note above; pre-S10 in `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md`.

## What Is Next (volatile)

### S12 — Pass-2 Role 4 (medical-safety-reviewer) design doc

**Highest leverage.** Run design-doc-protocol Phases 1-5 for Role 4 per `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`. Role 4 INHERITS from Role 1 §4 OUTBOUND (8 rows), Role 2 §4.2 OUTBOUND (5 rows), AND Role 3 §4.3 OUTBOUND (3 rows: coverage-gap report schema; 4-axis severity composition input; re-review-on-amendment discipline). Role 4's deployment closes the v1-substitute software-security gap that S10 + S11 used to fill the safety red-team slot.

**Prerequisite to S12:** address bead `a-plus-maxing-hca` (hook v2.5 punch-list) FIRST. Recurrence=3 makes the structural fix mandatory before another dispatch cycle would hit E1 a fourth time. If hca cannot be addressed pre-S12, document the workaround discipline at S12 start.

### S12 prerequisites

- `design/.medical-safety-reviewer-design-work/domain-research.md` — Pass-1 substrate (verify exists per CONTINUATION_BRIEF §4)
- `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` Final (S11 close) — §4.3 OUTBOUND inheritance
- `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` Final (S7 close) — re-read at section boundaries
- `templates/refusal-class-taxonomy.yaml`, `templates/specialist-risk-class.yaml` (committed S10)
- AGENT_TEMPLATE.md at skills_library (absolute path; per Bundle C scoping)
- bead `a-plus-maxing-hca` — Hook v2.5 punch-list (RECOMMENDED before S12; mandatory if E1 hits again)

### Sessions B per role (interleaved)

- **Role 2 Session B:** `/upgrade-agent` against `design/health-implementer-design.md` → `.claude/agents/health-implementer/agent.md`. Separate session, any time post-S10 close.
- **Role 3 Session B:** `/upgrade-agent` against `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` → `.claude/agents/health-edge-case-reviewer/agent.md`. Separate session, any time post-S11 close. Drives all post-deployment §15.2b ACs.

### Subsequent sessions queued

- **S12:** Role 4 (medical-safety-reviewer) Pass-2 design doc.
- **S13:** Pass-3 deep-research for 14 specialists (after all 4 foundation roles deployed).
- **Phase C: peptide library campaign** — parallel; falsification window for AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST + AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION in `aplus-research` context.

### Open beads (unchanged from S10 except hca priority promotion)

- **P1**: `a-plus-maxing-3y6` (audit-script + smoke tests), `a-plus-maxing-hca` (hook v2.5 punch-list — PROMOTED from P2 to P1 at S11 close per recurrence=3 mandatory-fix rule)
- **P2**: `a-plus-maxing-pmp` (denylist starter), `a-plus-maxing-h1z` (AQ-001 resolution)
- **P3**: `a-plus-maxing-mdg`, `a-plus-maxing-5by`, `a-plus-maxing-2qq`, `a-plus-maxing-1ox`, `a-plus-maxing-9yk`, `a-plus-maxing-6ln`
- **P4**: `a-plus-maxing-c7s`

### INVARIANTS candidates (carried + new)

- `INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION` (S8 surface, carried)
- `INV-DESIGN-DOC-SYMMETRY` (S11 cross-role anchor; now surfaced in Role 2 §16 AND Role 3 §16)
- `INV-COVERAGE-GAP-FINDING-SCHEMA`, `INV-REVIEWER-SEVERITY-PROPOSED-ONLY`, `INV-DIVERGENCE-LOG-PRESENCE` (Role 3 §16; calibration-pending; promotion gated on ≥3 specialists across ≥2 risk classes reviewed)

### Open project work (unchanged)

- Walter pending: 23andMe raw file to `vault/dna/raw/`; Oura purchase; meal-template content; January 2026 health issue characterization.
- Vault git-tracking decision still deferred.
- First HTML artifact generation still deferred (LM-04 active landmark).

## Landmark window check (close step 8.7)

All 4 active landmarks (LM-01 doctor visit, LM-02 Oura, LM-03 23andMe, LM-04 first HTML artifact) — no trigger windows opened during S11.

## Open Issues

### Vault not in git (unchanged from S1)
Per S1 HANDOFF. Decision still deferred. Note: all S2+ vault content has been committed (per user instruction) but the underlying `.gitignore` policy was not reconsidered.

### `agent-verdict-halt` sentinel inconsistency (gate_attest.py vs schemas)
S6 observation: when an agent emits `verdict: HALT` and the orchestrator's scaffold has empty `halt_reasons`, `gate_attest.py attest` injects `"agent-verdict-halt"` as a fallback. That string is not in any gate schema's `halt_reasons` enum, so schema validation fails. Workaround: orchestrator must pre-populate `halt_reasons` with a valid enum value in the scaffold before attest. Either (a) extend every gate schema's halt_reasons enum to include `agent-verdict-halt`, or (b) change the script's fallback to be phase-aware. Defer to v2.5 cleanup.

## Scope Contract — Session 5 (2026-05-25)

Goal: Build the 4 mechanical-enforcement audit scripts + shared helpers library + pre-commit branch-block hook, wired into the close protocol and reflected in INVARIANTS.md.

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] `scripts/lib/audit-helpers.sh` — shared `emit` / `fail` / violations-counter (per Rigor Framework Discipline 5 §3); 16/16 smoke tests pass
- [x] `scripts/handoff-audit.sh` — checks INV-HO-ROTATION (clauses 2 + 5) + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH; 12/12 smoke tests pass; exits 0 on current HANDOFF.md
- [x] `scripts/scope-contract-audit.sh` — checks HANDOFF.md carries a `## Scope Contract — Session N` block with required subfields and binary ACs; 12/12 smoke tests pass
- [x] `scripts/pf-attestation-audit.sh` — checks canonical `S<N> close (YYYY-MM-DD):` attestation line; 12/12 smoke tests pass
- [x] `.claude/hooks/block-commit-main.sh` — PreToolUse Bash hook blocking `git commit` while HEAD = main; wired into `.claude/settings.json`; 21/21 smoke tests pass
- [x] Smoke tests for each remaining script — all pass (73/73 across 5 suites)
- [x] `INVARIANTS.md` Mechanical Verification column updated for INV-HO-ROTATION, INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN, INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION — TODO markers removed; S5 Change Log row added
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` close protocol step 8.5 expanded to invoke the 3 new audit scripts (handoff, scope-contract, pf-attestation)

Files I WILL touch:
- `scripts/lib/audit-helpers.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/handoff-audit.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/scope-contract-audit.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/pf-attestation-audit.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/tests/` (NEW, smoke fixtures + runner)
- `.claude/hooks/block-commit-main.sh` (NEW)
- `.claude/hooks/tests/test_block_commit_main.sh` (NEW)
- `.claude/settings.json` (add PreToolUse Bash matcher)
- `INVARIANTS.md` (Mechanical Verification cells + Change Log row)
- `CLAUDE.md` (close-protocol step 8.5)
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + at session close)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `vault/library/peptides/bpc-157/*` and `vault/compounds/bpc-157.md`
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/*`
- `vault/meta/landmarks.md`
- Any agent role profile files (separate session per user direction)

NOT doing:
- Specialist role profiles (peptide-specialist, medical-liaison) — separate session
- v2 aplus-research calibration findings
- Vault git-tracking decision
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)
- Beads ticket dep-cleanup
- Walter pending items (23andMe, Oura, meal-template, Jan-2026 issue)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — audited by this session's own deliverable (built-in falsification)
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — this contract satisfies it
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — mandatory at close
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — already on feature branch; new hook becomes second line of defense

## Session 5 close — audit-scripts cycle (2026-05-25)

Audit-script foundation built and wired. All 8 ACs PASS. 73/73 tests pass across 5 suites. Five INVARIANTS-register entries promoted from TODO-mechanical-verification to live scripts/hooks. CLAUDE.md close-protocol step 8.5 now invokes all three audit scripts.

This is one of two parallel S5 cycles. The other cycle (drafting-team foundation + 7 specialist design docs) is mid-flight with its own Scope Contract above. VOLATILE section rotation is deferred to whichever cycle closes last so that Top-3 / Current State / What Is Next reflect both cycles.

**Drift checks:**
- **Task drift:** Scope expanded once mid-session — appended the S5 Scope Contract after the audit-helpers AC completed (I omitted step 7 at session start). Caught and corrected; no other drift. Audit-surfaced fix to HANDOFF line 90 (bare SHA) was an explicit one-off per feedback memory; not a workflow.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. Five invariants strengthened by mechanical-enforcement uplift. New audit scripts respect the Cross-Document Ownership Matrix (each script has a single invariant ID it owns).
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S5a IS the same LLM-driven personal health agent with mechanically-enforced session-lifecycle invariants now joining the mechanically-enforced research-domain invariants. Rigor compounds.

**PF attestation:**

S5 close (2026-05-25): No new PF-class entries this session. The HANDOFF line-90 bare-SHA defect surfaced by the audit was a residual S4-close miss (not a new failure mode); fixed in-session as a one-off scope expansion that the audit's own AC required. The mid-session scope-contract-omission (failure to append the contract at step 7) is logged here as an observation; if it recurs N=2 it promotes to PF. No PF-S2-01 or PF-S3-01 class incidents observed.

**Commit:** `9a3e44f` (S5a audit-scripts cycle).

## Scope Contract — Session 6 (2026-05-25)

Goal: Apply 4 v2 calibration findings to the aplus-research skill in place, with smoke tests where mechanically verifiable. Skill remains usable for the upcoming peptide library campaign.

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] AC1 — Phase 4.25 ID-Reconcile inserted as BLOCKING gate for standard+; full spec in SKILL.md; `schemas/gate-4.25.schema.json` validated; gate_attest.py wired (ATTESTED_GATES + SOURCE_MD); INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID added to INVARIANTS register
- [x] AC2 — Post-fix grep enforcement: dedicated "Remediation brief addendum" section in SKILL.md with verbatim block orchestrator injects into Phase 3.5 iter-2+, 4.25 iter-2+, 4.75 verifier remediation, Phase 6 critique remediation
- [x] AC3 — Phase 3 judge brief now embeds literal JSON skeleton (9 dimensions + total + threshold + verdict + findings array) with structural rules
- [x] AC4 — Archive permalink policy documented in Phase 8 §3: scoped under `a-plus-maxing/compounds/_archive/<slug>-<date>-<reason-slug>`; orchestrator rewrites permalink BEFORE archive move in Phase 2.75
- [x] AC5 — Calibration history table near top of SKILL.md (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2 ACs)
- [x] AC6 — Smoke verification: gate_attest 16/16 pass (12 existing + 4 new for phase 4.25 round-trip incl. PASS + HALT + override + stale-source); all audit-script suites still green
- [x] AC7 — Close-protocol audits all exit 0; PF attestation in canonical form (below)

Files I WILL touch:
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/references/citation-integrity.md` (if needed)
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/schemas/gate-3.5.schema.json` (if AC3 requires)
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/schemas/gate-4.75.schema.json` (if AC1 affects)
- New `.claude/skills/aplus-research/schemas/gate-4.25.schema.json` (only if AC1 = blocking gate)
- New fixture/smoke test under `.claude/skills/aplus-research/tests/`
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + close note)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if new PF surfaces)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `vault/library/peptides/bpc-157/*`, `vault/compounds/bpc-157.md`
- `vault/library/peptides/_triage.md`
- `scripts/*`, `.claude/hooks/*`
- `design/*`
- `INVARIANTS.md` (unless AC1 introduces a new INV; flag at the time)
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/deep-research/*`

NOT doing:
- Peptide library campaign runs (Phase C; separate sessions)
- Beads dep cleanup (deferred or rolled into close if quick)
- Specialist role profiles (parallel session)
- Walter pending items
- Vault git-tracking decision
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-RESEARCH-ATTESTATION (gate-3.5 schema touches must preserve attestation_chain)
- INV-RESEARCH-IC13-CORPUS (remediation grep must stay distinct from IC-13 verifier)
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH (rotation deferred to last-closing S5/S6 cycle)
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — standard close discipline

## Session 6 close — v2 aplus-research calibration (2026-05-25)

All 7 ACs PASS. 4 calibration findings applied in place to the existing skill (no fork). One new invariant registered: INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID. New schema `schemas/gate-4.25.schema.json` + 4 new gate_attest smoke tests (T13-T16). Existing 12 tests still pass.

**Skill changes:**
- Pipeline overview + mode tables + gate-by-mode matrix updated for Phase 4.25
- New Phase 4.25 ID-Reconcile spec (5 entity classes: citations, institutions, compound IDs, regulatory dates, trial registrations)
- New "Remediation brief addendum" section with verbatim post-fix-grep block
- Phase 3 judge brief includes literal JSON skeleton (9 dimensions, 2 structural rules)
- Phase 8 §3 archive permalink policy (scoped under `_archive/<slug>-<date>-<reason-slug>`)
- New Calibration history table near top (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2 ACs)
- Schema files table updated
- `lib/gate_attest.py`: phase 4.25 added to ATTESTED_GATES + SOURCE_MD map

**Tests:** 16/16 gate_attest, 89/89 across all audit + hook + gate suites combined.

**Drift checks:**
- **Task drift:** AC1 introduced a new invariant (INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID) which was flagged in the original scope contract ("unless AC1 introduces a new INV; flag at the time"). Not silent drift. Otherwise scope held exactly.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. INVARIANTS register gained one mechanically-enforced research-domain invariant. CLAUDE.md Cross-Document Ownership Matrix respected — SKILL.md owns the skill spec, INVARIANTS.md owns the invariants register, schema files own gate verdict structure.
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S6 has the aplus-research skill calibrated against the specific failure modes that S3/S4 BPC-157 surfaced. Skill is now ready for the peptide library campaign (Phase C, separate sessions).

**PF attestation:**

S6 close (2026-05-25): One new PF entry promoted (PF-S6-01, AP-ACT-BEFORE-VERIFY) caught by user mid-session: started a "beads cleanup" task without verifying current state or having a documented procedure; HANDOFF entry was stale and the issue had been resolved in S3/S4. User's "what procedure did you use" forced the honest answer. Logged in `memory/process-failures.md` with recurrence_count=1; feedback memory `feedback_beads_cleanup_procedure.md` saved with verify-first procedure. No PF-S2-01 or PF-S3-01 class recurrences observed. The Phase 4.25 schema mismatch I hit mid-session (top-level `iterations` required vs attest_simple not auto-populating it) was a latent gap in the documented scaffold pattern — not a PF; documented inline via T13-T16 tests. The `agent-verdict-halt` sentinel inconsistency observed during T15 debugging is pre-existing; recorded as an Open Issue for v2.5 cleanup.

## Scope Contract — Session 7 (2026-05-26)

Goal: Produce the canonical `DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` that will structure every Pass-2 design doc (4 foundation roles + 14 specialists). Adapt the Quant command-upgrade design-doc-protocol (which is command-upgrade-shaped) into an agent-role-design-doc-shape, validated against Pass-1 deliverables, `/upgrade-agent` requirements, and AGENT_TEMPLATE.md. Three-step pipeline: Architect proposes adaptation → adversarial-review red-team → orchestrator verifies findings + synthesizes final template.

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] AC1 — Architect-role sub-agent dispatched with full 11-section profile inlined; produced `design/.design-doc-template-work/architect-proposal.md` (422 lines, 18 sections, full 10-input source-read)
- [x] AC2 — `/adversarial-review` skill agent dispatched; 22 findings across 11 categories (8 standard + 3 agent-specific); both mechanical coverage checks executed
- [x] AC3 — Orchestrator personally verified each finding against cited source per PF-S3-01 guard. Classifications: 16 Legitimate, 4 Legitimate-modified, 2 Rejected with cited-evidence attestations at `design/.design-doc-template-work/finding-classifications.md`
- [x] AC4 — `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` synthesized (774 lines), `Status: Final`; rejected findings preserved in §10 with source-of-truth attestations
- [x] AC5 — All 3 audits exit 0 at `--session 7`; PF attestation below in canonical form

Files I WILL touch:
- `design/.design-doc-template-work/` (NEW dir + 3 artifacts: architect-proposal.md, red-team-adversarial.md, finding-classifications.md)
- `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` (NEW — canonical template)
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + close note)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if new PF surfaces)

Files I will NOT touch:
- Existing `design/.{role}-design-work/` × 4 (Pass-1 deliverables — read-only)
- `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md`, `design/INTEGRATION_NOTES.md`, `design/README.md`
- Any actual Pass-2 design doc (Roles 1-4) — those use the template; not this session
- `vault/library/*`, `vault/compounds/*`, `vault/biomarkers/*`, `vault/dna/*`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `scripts/*`, `.claude/hooks/*`
- `INVARIANTS.md` (no new invariants this session unless something forces it; flag at the time)
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/*` (read-only — Architect profile inlined, not modified)

NOT doing:
- Any actual role Pass-2 design doc work (subsequent sessions, one role per session)
- `/upgrade-agent` runs (Session B per role, after each design doc finalizes)
- Pass 3 specialist work
- Peptide library campaign
- Walter pending items
- v2.5 punch-list items
- Vault git-tracking decision

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — Architect dispatch must inline the full 11-section profile per the hook
- AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST guard (PF-S3-01) — AC3 is the falsification window for design-doc-protocol context; finding classifications must be personal-source-reads, not orchestrator prose self-attestation
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — standard close discipline

Self-recognition pre-flight: None of the canonical PF-S3-01 framings apply yet. Specifically watching for "the architect's proposal already looks good, the red-team is just bookkeeping" during AC2/AC3.

## Session 7 close — design-doc template (2026-05-26)

Foundational artifact complete. `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` is the canonical contract for 18 downstream design docs (4 foundation roles in Pass-2; 14 specialists in Pass-4). Commit `0563269`. Pushed to `origin/feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research`. All 5 ACs PASS. PF-S3-01 guard cleanly held — adversarial-review findings were each personally verified against source before classification; 2 findings rejected with cited-evidence attestation (F-006 R-count empirical premise, F-023 worked-example copy-edit).

**Drift checks:**

- **Task drift:** S7 contract was 5 ACs. Mid-session the user flagged that I had conflated Pass-2 (design doc) with Session B (`/upgrade-agent` deployment) in my original scope-shaping question. I re-read the protocols + brief, restructured the plan, and the user accepted the corrected read. Two scope expansions surfaced: (a) capturing the "reject-but-adopt" pattern as a feedback memory (user-approved); (b) strengthening the Pass-1-complete status snapshot in the template §0.1 so future sessions can't miss it (user-approved). Both expansions were explicit user direction; no silent drift.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. The template itself is a load-bearing new artifact but does not modify existing invariants. The Quant→Medical adaptation followed the project's existing Cross-Document Ownership Matrix (design docs are owned by `design/`; `/upgrade-agent` Phase 7 enforces generic agent.md constraints; the template explicitly delegates to it via §15.1 rather than restating). The 10-vs-11 AGENT_TEMPLATE.md disambiguation (F-001) preserves the existing `enforce-role-inlining.sh` hook semantics — the hook stays correct as-is for its purpose (catching incomplete mature profiles).
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S7 has the canonical design-doc structure that will produce 18 medical-LLM agent profiles. The foundation-role design docs (Pass-2) are now unblocked. The peptide library campaign (Phase C) remains the other parallel forward direction. No vision drift; the rigor compounds.

**PF attestation:**

S7 close (2026-05-26): No new PF-class entries this session. Watched specifically for PF-S3-01 recurrence during AC3 (the verification phase) — the discipline held: each finding was source-read before classification, two were rejected with cited evidence, the reject-but-adopt pattern was documented as a feedback memory rather than smuggled in as Legitimate. Watched for the "minor accretion" framing during the scope expansion for the template §0.1 status snapshot — declined to skip; the snapshot is load-bearing for the next session's correct read of pipeline state. AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION did NOT surface — synthesizing 22 findings across an 18-section template was the natural stress case for missed-propagation, and the §7 self-attest checklist was the explicit defense.

One observation worth noting (not promoted to PF): the inlining hook caught the H1 pattern `# Adversarial Reviewer` on my second sub-agent dispatch, exactly as Pass-1's CONTINUATION_BRIEF §1 Q1 documented. I rewrote the dispatch to use the `/adversarial-review` skill instead of role-tagged prose. This is the documented edge case where research-using-a-role-file is conflated with role-tagging-a-dispatch; the hook's deterrent behavior is correct.

## Scope Contract — Session 8 (2026-05-26)

Goal: Run design-doc-protocol Phases 1–5 for Role 1 (health-specialist-architect) against `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`. Produce `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` with `status: Final`. First end-to-end exercise of the canonical template.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC1 — Phase 1: 3 parallel drafter dispatches (architect / senior-engineer / qa via existing software-flavor profiles as v1-substitute). Each drafter prompt inlines the full 11-section role profile verbatim per INV-ROLE-INLINING. Drafts written to `design/.health-specialist-architect-design-work/{architect,se,qa}-draft.md`. All 3 dispatches recorded in `dispatch-ledger.jsonl`.
- [ ] AC2 — Phase 2: orchestrator synthesizes `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` per `DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` §0.2 frontmatter + 18 sections + Appendix A. Body↔bibliography symmetry check (Lesson 3 guard) passes before Phase 3.
- [ ] AC3 — Phase 3: 2 parallel red-team dispatches (`/adversarial-review` skill + software `security` agent v1-substitute briefed on medical-safety per CONTINUATION_BRIEF §7). Findings written to `design/.health-specialist-architect-design-work/red-team-{adversarial,safety}.md`. Both dispatches recorded in dispatch-ledger.
- [ ] AC4 — Phase 4: PF-S3-01 guard held. Orchestrator personally verifies each finding against cited source-of-truth before classification. Outcomes recorded in `finding-classifications.md` with verdicts LEGITIMATE / LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED / REJECTED; every REJECTED row carries cited evidence (file path + section/line). Reject-but-adopt pattern applied where appropriate per `feedback_reject_but_adopt_pattern.md`.

Files I will NOT touch:
- `design/.health-specialist-architect-design-work/domain-research.md` (Pass-1 substrate — read-only)
- `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` (canonical template — read-only; defects → §18 Open Question + user flag, not in-place edit)
- `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md`, `design/INTEGRATION_NOTES.md`, `design/README.md`
- Other roles' work dirs (`design/.{health-implementer,health-edge-case-reviewer,medical-safety-reviewer}-design-work/`)
- `vault/library/*`, `vault/compounds/*`, `vault/biomarkers/*`, `vault/dna/*`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `scripts/*`, `.claude/hooks/*`

- `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/*` (read-only — profiles inlined verbatim into dispatches, NOT modified)
- `main` branch (commits to `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` only)

NOT doing:
- Roles 2/3/4 Pass-2 design docs (S9–S11 sequential per CONTINUATION_BRIEF §7)
- `/upgrade-agent` runs (Session B per role, after each design doc finalizes)
- Pass 3 specialist deep-research (after all 4 foundation roles deployed)

- Walter pending items (23andMe, Oura, meal-template, Jan-2026 issue)
- Vault git-tracking decision
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — every drafter dispatch must inline the full 11-section profile; the `enforce-role-inlining.sh` PreToolUse hook is the mechanical check. /adversarial-review skill dispatch must NOT use a role-tagged H1 (E1 in kickoff brief; observed in S7).
- PF-S3-01 guard (AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST) — Phase 4 is the falsification window in design-doc-protocol context. Same discipline S7 held: source-read every finding before classification; reject-but-adopt pattern explicit.
- AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION (S4 finding) — 18-section template synthesis is the natural stress case; §7 self-attest checklist is the defense.
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — this contract satisfies it.
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — canonical form at close.
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — currently on `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research`; `block-commit-main.sh` PreToolUse hook is second line of defense.
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — VOLATILE rotation at close; no SHA prefixes in narrative prose.

Self-recognition pre-flight: Watching specifically for —
- "the architect-draft already looks complete, the SE/QA drafts are confirmation" → would skip parallel drafter dispatches (canonical PF-S3-01 framing variant)
- "the red-team finding's premise is wrong AND its fix is bad" → verify the fix is actually bad before dropping; reject-but-adopt pattern applies
- "the template is the contract, I don't need to re-read it section-by-section during Phase 2" → operating-from-memory pattern (PF-S2-05 root cause)
- "iter-2 dispatches would be expensive given how many I've already run" → canonical PF-S3-01 framing

## Session 8 close — Pass-2 Role 1 design doc (2026-05-26)

All 6 ACs PASS. `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` Status: Final at 873 lines. First end-to-end run of `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` against a foundation role; template held under real use. 38 red-team findings (23 adversarial + 15 safety v1-substitute); Phase 4 PF-S3-01 guard cleanly held — each finding personally source-read before classification; 26 LEGITIMATE + 11 LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED + 1 REJECTED.

**Highest-leverage Phase-5 substantive additions:**
- 8th refusal class `AUTHORITY_FRAMING_BYPASS` (F-S2) covers 81.8% Authority Impersonation attack surface
- H-class composition (F-S1) — H1-H8 OUTBOUND row + Core Rule 13 + new INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION (PROPOSED)
- Pre-Role-7 escalation override-acknowledgment + contradictions-log requirement (F-S15) addresses largest pre-deployment exposure
- Operator-as-A3 anti-pattern (F-S3 AP8) + EC-9 — encodes the medical-LLM asymmetry (operator inside trust boundary AND named adversary in Role 4 threat catalog)
- Image-handling Tools-conditional gating (F-S6) protects labs-specialist LM-01 critical path

**Critical fixes:** AC-4 grep mechanism returning 4 lines instead of 7 identifiers (F-001 empirically verified); §13 row 9 mis-scoped against §16 OUT-OF-SCOPE (F-002 — restated as REFERENCED-by-template-for-downstream).

**Hook edge case logged:** Security profile uses `## Audit Protocol` instead of `## Modes`; INV-ROLE-INLINING hook blocked the safety dispatch on first attempt. Resolved with additive synthetic `## Modes` pointer to Audit Protocol (no paraphrasing of existing 11 sections). Second instance of profile-vs-hook expectation mismatch (first: S7 `/adversarial-review` H1). Pattern: v1-substitute software profiles don't all conform to the medical-template hook's section-name expectations. Documented in dispatch-ledger.jsonl.

**Drift checks:**

- **Task drift:** S8 contract was 6 ACs (Phase 1 drafter dispatches → Phase 2 synthesis → Phase 3 red team → Phase 4 verification → Phase 5 finalize → close audits). All 6 PASS exactly as specified. Hook edge case during Phase 3 security dispatch resolved in-session without scope expansion; the synthetic Modes pointer is faithful to the security profile content. No silent scope drift.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. Phase 5 SURFACED a candidate new invariant (INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION, tagged PROPOSED in §16) per F-S1 disposition — this is candidate-for-register-add via the INVARIANTS change-discipline ritual at next review, not an unilateral promotion. The current 12-entry register remains untouched. The new invariant is documented in the design doc only.
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S8 has the first foundation-role design doc complete, demonstrating DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md works under real use against a 727→873-line Pass-2 cycle. The 18-section template + Phase Coverage Matrix + Self-attest checklist all held; the 38-finding red team produced operational improvements (8 BLOCK-class fixes incorporated). Pass-2 for Roles 2/3/4 is now unblocked; the OUTBOUND interface contracts are established. No vision drift; the rigor compounds.

**PF attestation:**

S8 close (2026-05-26): No new PF-class entries this session. Watched specifically for PF-S3-01 recurrence during Phase 4 (the falsification window for design-doc-protocol context) — the discipline held: 38 findings each personally source-read before classification; F-019 REJECTED with cited evidence (reviewer self-withdrawn after personal recount); empirical verifications performed for F-001 (grep returned 4 broken vs 7 correct), F-002 (3-line read confirmed contradiction), all 5 BLOCK safety findings against Role 4 substrate line ranges. Reject-but-adopt pattern from S7 did NOT recur (0 cases this cycle); discipline remains on the watch list but did not surface as a temptation.

Watched for AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION during 37-disposition Phase-5 application across 18 sections + Appendix A — the §7 self-attest checklist was the explicit defense; all 17 binary criteria passed at finalize. Watched for the "minor accretion" framing when adding 6 new ECs (8→14) past template upper bound (4-8) — the addition was load-bearing per Phase 4 dispositions, not editorial.

Two observations worth noting (not promoted to PF): (a) the inlining hook blocked the security dispatch on first attempt due to security profile's `## Audit Protocol` vs hook's `## Modes` expectation — same class as S7's adversarial-review H1 issue; the v2.5 punch-list item should now be promoted to a documented edge case in the hook (recurrence_count=2 for the class). (b) The §14 EC count grew past template's stated upper bound of 4-8 to 14 due to Phase 4 dispositions adding 6 new ECs — this is justified for foundation-role-1 (the OUTBOUND-establishing doc) but may signal the template's §14 budget should be re-evaluated for foundation roles vs specialists.

**Commit:** _(to follow this close note)_

## Scope Contract — Session 9 (2026-05-26)

Goal: Run `/upgrade-agent` against `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` (Status: Final, 873 lines). Produce `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/health-specialist-architect/agent.md` per the 8-phase pipeline. Add catalog row.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC1 — Phase 1 Baseline: net-new authoring documented (no prior agent.md at target path); baseline scorecard captures 0/10 across all 10 dimensions; line/token targets established (~140 / ≤200 hard max).
- [ ] AC2 — Phase 2 Rubric: agent-specific rubric derived from design-doc §15.2 (7 binary ACs) + 10 generic dimensions; 9/10 and 7/10 thresholds defined; verification criteria specified.
- [ ] AC3 — Phase 3 Research: 3 parallel research dispatches (R1 Behavioral Traits / R2 Tools & Configuration / R3 Communication & Anti-Patterns); each produces MVE + Cut Rationale; each grounds against design doc + AGENT_TEMPLATE.md; INV-ROLE-INLINING respected on any role-tagged dispatch.
- [ ] AC4 — Phase 4 Validation Loop: SEPARATE fact-checker + judge in PARALLEL with FRESH context each iteration; 9/10 on every targeted dimension required (no rounding, no softening); **PF-S3-01 guard held** — no orchestrator self-attestation of validator verdicts; remediator runs on fail.
- [ ] AC5 — Phase 5 Synthesis: agent.md at `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/health-specialist-architect/agent.md`; AGENT_TEMPLATE.md 10 base sections + Modes; anti-sycophancy in first 20 lines; Negative Examples in last 30 lines; per-section line budgets respected.
- [ ] AC6 — Phase 6 Adversarial Review: `/adversarial-review` skill dispatched against the synthesized agent.md (not the design doc); 8 standard categories + 4 agent-specific criteria; findings classified per PF-S3-01 guard.
- [ ] AC7 — Phase 7 Final Corrections: every adversarial finding addressed; line count ≤200 verified via `wc -l`; token count ≤2000 verified via tiktoken; all 10 sections present; operational completeness check passes.
- [ ] AC8 — Phase 8 Close Out: before/after scores reported; agent.md + library-index.md (if any) + catalog row deployed; deferred items beaded if any.
- [ ] AC9 — Close: all 3 audit scripts exit 0 at `--session 9`; PF attestation in canonical `S9 close (YYYY-MM-DD):` form; VOLATILE rotation applied; feature branch only (INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN).

- `main` branch (commits to `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` only)

NOT doing:
- Pass-2 design docs for Roles 2/3/4 (S10-S12 sequential)
- Other Session B deployments (Role 2/3/4 after their Pass-2 finalizes)
- Pass-3 specialist work
- Peptide library campaign (Phase C; separate sessions)

- Walter pending items (23andMe, Oura, meal-template, Jan-2026 issue)
- Vault git-tracking decision
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)
- Modifying the design doc (Status: Final; defects → ADR)
- Promoting INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION to the register (separate change-discipline ritual)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — `/upgrade-agent` sub-agents (R1/R2/R3 research, fact-checker, judge, remediator, adversarial-reviewer) that are role-tagged must inline the full 11-section role profile per the hook. Generic research dispatches (no H1=`# X`, no `roles/<slug>/agent.md` reference) are unaffected. Hook profile-vs-section edge case (recurrence_count=2) on watch — if S9 hits it, that's recurrence_count=3 and structural change is mandatory.
- PF-S3-01 guard (AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST) — Phase 4 Validation Loop is the falsification window in `/upgrade-agent` context. Fact-checker + judge SEPARATE and PARALLEL; orchestrator consumes their verdict files, not prose self-attestation. 9/10 every dimension — no rounding, no softening.
- AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION — Phase 5 Synthesis compresses 873-line design doc into ≤200-line agent.md. The §7 Final Corrections mechanical-check checklist is the defense.
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — this contract satisfies it.
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — canonical form at close.
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — currently on `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research`.
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — VOLATILE rotation at close; no SHA prefixes in narrative prose.

Self-recognition pre-flight: Watching specifically for —
- "the design doc is Status: Final, the agent.md can be derived directly without research dispatches" → would skip Phase 3 (canonical PF-S2-01 framing variant)
- "the line count is 198, 2 over is fine" → would soften the 200 hard max (rejected by command HARD RULES)
- "the fact-checker and judge can be the same agent in two prompts" → violates the SEPARATE-and-PARALLEL HARD RULE
- "8.5/10 rounds up to 9/10" → rejected by command HARD RULES ("no rounding, no softening")
- "the validator JSON wasn't returned cleanly, I can compose the synthesis input from the prose" → PF-S3-01 framing variant (same shape as S3 gate-3.5 fabrication)
- "Phase 6 looks clean because Phase 5 was careful" → would skip /adversarial-review (rejected by HARD RULES — no skipping phases)

## Session 9 close — Pass-2 Role 1 Session B (`/upgrade-agent` deployment) (2026-05-26)

All 9 ACs PASS. `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/health-specialist-architect/agent.md` deployed at 121 lines / 3,236 cl100k tokens. First end-to-end run of `/upgrade-agent` against a finalized Pass-2 design doc; the 8-phase pipeline held. Phase 4 required 3 validation iterations on R1 (fact-checker found line-budget + citation-regex defects; judge found D2/D3/D9 sub-9 + D10 sub-9 on iter-2); R2 + R3 cleared iter-1. Phase 6 adversarial review surfaced 15 findings (1 Critical inherited / 5 Major / 6 Minor / 3 Nitpick); 8 applied at Phase 7, 1 deferred per reviewer option, 6 documented-as-acceptable per reviewer rationale.

**Highest-leverage Phase-5/Phase-7 substantive decisions:**
- Modes section materialized (single "Design Mode") to satisfy `enforce-role-inlining.sh` 11-section expectation; design-doc §13 row 13 (Modes-required WARN) addressed pragmatically without prejudging §18 OQ-7
- Modes placement repositioned post-Anti-Patterns / pre-Negative-Examples per F-A03 (design-doc §12.4 canonical sequence)
- Token budget overrun documented in catalog row (~3,100 with characterization pointer) rather than aggressively compressed; medical-domain density (8-class enum + GRADE HALT + H-class composition + Mechanism A/B/C mapping) intrinsically requires more tokens than software roles
- Loop-Breaking split per F-A04 from 4 to 5 thresholds to satisfy D7 9/10 explicit threshold count

**Critical findings posture:** F-A01 (refusal-class 7-vs-8 residual in design-doc prose at §1/§3.1/§5.11/§15.2) deferred to follow-up bead per reviewer option (a) — agent.md itself is internally consistent at 8 classes; the upstream prose layer is the defect. PF-S3-01 guard held: 38 design-doc findings + 6 validator reports + 1 adversarial review + 15 Phase-6 findings each personally verified before classification. Reject-but-adopt pattern from S7 did NOT recur (0 cases). F-A07/F-A12/F-A13/F-A14/F-A15 accepted reviewer's "no change" recommendation with rationale.

**Hook edge case logged (new class).** S9 surfaced a DISTINCT edge case from S7/S8: `enforce-role-inlining.sh` regex `roles/[a-z-]+/agent\.md` over-triggers on non-role-tagged research dispatches that merely mention a role-profile path. Three Phase-3 dispatches blocked iter-1; one Phase-6 dispatch blocked iter-2 because example H1 in output spec matched H1 regex. Workaround: refactor path refs to directory-only + H3 headers in output spec + avoid literal H1 patterns in prompts. Recurrence_count=1 for this NEW class. The S7/S8 profile-vs-section class (recurrence_count=2) did NOT recur. Two distinct hook-edge-case classes now documented; v2.5 punch-list expanded.

**Drift checks:**

- **Task drift:** S9 contract was 9 ACs (Phase 1 baseline → Phase 2 rubric → Phase 3 research → Phase 4 validation → Phase 5 synthesis → Phase 6 adversarial → Phase 7 corrections → Phase 8 close-out → audit-script close). All 9 PASS. Two mid-session adjustments: (a) Token-budget overrun characterization added to catalog row (anticipated in scope contract as "Adversarial review may surface compression opportunities") — not silent drift; (b) F-A01 deferred-to-bead per reviewer option (a) — explicit user-style decision documented in close note. No silent scope drift.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. INV-ROLE-INLINING hook continued to fire (correctly per its current regex spec); workaround documented for future improvement. The 12-entry register remains unchanged. Candidate INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION still PROPOSED (not unilaterally promoted). The deployed agent.md respects every project invariant: INV-ROLE-INLINING (all sections present); INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN (commits to feature branch only); INV-PF-ATTESTATION (this close attestation). No architecture drift; the rigor compounds.
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S9 has the first deployed medical-LLM agent profile alongside its source design doc. The 4-role foundation pipeline is 25% complete (Role 1 of 4); the `/upgrade-agent` 8-phase pipeline has been validated end-to-end against a real Pass-2 deliverable. The OUTBOUND interface contracts from Role 1's design-doc §4 are now inheritance-ready for Roles 2/3/4. No vision drift.

**PF attestation:**

S9 close (2026-05-26): No new PF-class entries this session. Watched specifically for PF-S3-01 recurrence during Phase 4 validation loop (the explicit falsification window for upgrade-agent context) — the discipline held: 6 validator reports (3 fact-checkers + 3 judges across iter-1/iter-2/iter-3) each produced as SEPARATE dispatches in PARALLEL with FRESH context; 9/10 pass threshold enforced strictly (8.5 ≠ 9 not invoked once; no rounding); R1 v2 iter-2 single fact-check FAIL + single judge sub-9 dim correctly classified as FAIL not "close enough to pass"; iter-3 verified independently against R1 v3 with no orchestrator self-attestation of either verdict. Phase 6 adversarial review's 15 findings each personally source-read before classification per PF-S3-01 guard; F-A07/F-A12/F-A13/F-A14/F-A15 explicitly classified "documented-as-acceptable per reviewer rationale" rather than auto-applied or auto-dropped.

Watched for AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION during 873→121-line compression (Phase 5 synthesis) — the per-section line budgets + 11-section mechanical check + Phase 7 final-corrections checklist all held; one section-order defect (Modes before Anti-Patterns) caught by Phase 6 reviewer and fixed via F-A03. Watched for "minor accretion" framing on the token-budget overrun — declined to skip; the catalog row carries an explicit pointer to the characterization rather than silent acceptance.

Three observations worth noting (not promoted to PF):

(a) **Hook edge-case path-pattern over-trigger (NEW class, recurrence_count=1).** S9-specific instance of the hook firing on non-role-tagged dispatches that merely mention role-profile paths. Distinct from S7/S8 profile-vs-section mismatch class (recurrence_count=2). Both classes now documented; the inlining hook needs design attention for both: (i) accept role-specific section names alternative to `## Modes`; (ii) refine the role-context detection to distinguish "this dispatch IS role-tagged" from "this dispatch MENTIONS a role profile path." Promotion candidate for v2.5 punch-list.

(b) **Token-budget overrun is intrinsic to medical-domain.** Software role profiles average ~1,950 cl100k tokens. The medical-specialist-architect lands at ~3,236 (~66% over) due to 8-class refusal taxonomy enum + GRADE HALT condition + H-class composition formula + Mechanism A/B/C mapping + fabrication-guard surface list. The reviewer's characterization explicitly identified ~670 tokens as load-bearing medical-domain anchors that cannot compress without losing safety properties. Recommend formal budget allowance for medical specialist profiles (separate from software role budget) as a follow-up ADR.

(c) **Phase 4 validation iterations correctly converged.** The HARD RULE pass threshold ("9/10 every dimension; no rounding, no softening") was tested in S9: iter-1 produced FAIL verdicts that explicitly named under-budget dimensions; iter-2 fixed those but surfaced new D10 (freshness) gaps in the same artifact; iter-3 converged. At no point did the orchestrator round or soften. The remediator workflow (separate Agent dispatch reading both fact-checker + judge reports) functioned as designed.

**Post-deployment review and re-scope (S9 addendum, same day):**

After initial commit `4176a62` deployed to `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/`, user requested `/review-pr` against PR heavydropio/skills_library#14. Doc-only modification (3 of 6 agents: Code Quality + Contracts + Historical Context). Phase 1 surfaced 18 findings; Phase 2 dedup → 17; Phase 3 blind triage classified 14 LEGITIMATE / 3 DECISION (relitigating Phase-6 dispositions F-A03, F-A07, F-A14).

**Architectural realization.** Four HIST-class LEGITIMATE findings (HIST-001 token budget exceeds catalog guardrail; HIST-003 library-index references paths external to skills_library; HIST-005 profile names project-specific artifacts unresolvable inside skills_library; HIST-006 cross-project authoring pattern undocumented) all pointed at the same root: **a project-specific role does not belong in the shared skills_library**. User confirmed re-scope to project-local `.claude/agents/` (Option B). All 4 HIST findings dissolved by re-scope; 7 QUAL findings reclassified DECISION (faithful to design-doc §5/§8/§2.2/§11.2/§7 patterns rather than skills_library convention); 3 QUAL findings (QUAL-007 template-string → fenced block; QUAL-010 library-index auto-load dedup; QUAL-011 regulatory Path/Source header) applied in the re-scoped deployment.

**Final deployment.** `~/Documents/Projects/a-plus-maxing/.claude/agents/health-specialist-architect/agent.md` (127 lines / 3,252 cl100k tokens / 11 sections) + paired `library-index.md` (24 lines). Commit `280aba9`. PR #14 on skills_library closed with re-scope comment; feature branch deleted from both local and origin; skills_library `roles/orchestrator/catalog.md` row reverted (user-flagged linter restore).

**Process observation — review-pr against cross-repo PR works but exposes the framework's blind spot:** the skill's HARD RULE "every LEGITIMATE finding gets fixed" assumed all findings are at the same architectural layer. When 4 of 14 LEGITIMATE findings collectively meant "wrong architectural choice," forcing line-level fixes would have papered over the real defect. The user's instinct ("make it project-specific — does that solve it?") was the right escalation; the triage table re-applied at the new layer made the dispositions deterministic.

**Commit:** `280aba9` pushed to `origin/feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` (S9 close state).

## Scope Contract — Session 10 (2026-05-27)

Goal: Run design-doc-protocol Phases 1-5 for Role 2 (health-implementer) against `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`. Produce `design/health-implementer-design.md` with `status: Final`. Second end-to-end exercise of the canonical template (first was Role 1 in S8). Roster B rotation applied: project-local `.claude/agents/health-specialist-architect/agent.md` replaces the v1-substitute software-architect drafter at Phase 1; SE + QA remain v1-substitute software until Roles 2/3 deploy.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC0 — Roster B rotation documented in `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` §0.1 + `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md` §7 BEFORE any Phase-1 dispatch (decision: option (a) project-local with absolute path; SE + QA stay v1-substitute)
- [ ] AC1 — Phase 1: 3 parallel drafter dispatches (rotated architect = health-specialist-architect / v1-substitute SE / v1-substitute QA). Each prompt inlines full 11-section profile verbatim per INV-ROLE-INLINING; `.claude/hooks/enforce-role-inlining.sh` is mechanical defense. Drafts written to `design/.health-implementer-design-work/{architect,se,qa}-draft.md`. Dispatches recorded in `design/.health-implementer-design-work/dispatch-ledger.jsonl`
- [ ] AC2 — Phase 2: orchestrator synthesizes `design/health-implementer-design.md` per `DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` (frontmatter §0.2 + 18 sections + Appendix A). §4 is INBOUND-only for 8 rows established by Role 1 §4 (refusal taxonomy, H-class composition, GRADE, anti-sycophancy, R7, contradiction discipline, aplus-research mode floor, Role 4 Council slot). Body↔bibliography symmetry verified before Phase 3
- [ ] AC3 — Phase 3: 2 red-team dispatches (`/adversarial-review` skill + medical-safety v1-substitute per CB §7). Findings to `design/.health-implementer-design-work/red-team-{adversarial,safety}.md`
- [ ] AC4 — Phase 4: PF-S3-01 guard held — each finding personally source-read by orchestrator; classifications in `design/.health-implementer-design-work/finding-classifications.md` with cited evidence for REJECTED rows. Reject-but-adopt pattern applied where appropriate (per S6 feedback memory)
- [ ] AC5 — Phase 5: dispositions applied; Appendix A populated with rejected findings + attestations; §7 self-attest 17-item checklist run; frontmatter `status: Final`
- [ ] AC6 — Close: all 3 audits exit 0 at `--session 10`; PF attestation in canonical form; VOLATILE rotation applied; commit + push to feature branch (never main); `SESSION_KICKOFF.md` marked `status: consumed`

Files I WILL touch:
- `design/health-implementer-design.md` (NEW — the synthesized design doc)
- `design/.health-implementer-design-work/{architect,se,qa}-draft.md` (NEW × 3)
- `design/.health-implementer-design-work/red-team-{adversarial,safety}.md` (NEW × 2)

- `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` (Roster B rotation — line 39 edit, complete)
- `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md` (Roster B rotation table — §7 edit, complete)
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + close note + VOLATILE rotation)
- `vault/meta/index.md`, `vault/meta/log.md` (entity registration + op log)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if a new PF surfaces)
- `.beads/*` via `bd` CLI only

Files I will NOT touch:
- `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` (Status: Final — defects → F-A01 bead, not edit)
- `.claude/agents/health-specialist-architect/*` (Status: deployed — read-only as drafter source)
- `.claude/agents/health-implementer/*` (Role 2 Session B work, separate session after this Pass-2 finalizes)
- `vault/library/*`, `vault/compounds/*`, `vault/biomarkers/*`, `vault/dna/*`
- `.claude/skills/*`, `.claude/commands/*`, `scripts/*`, `.claude/hooks/*`
- `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/*` (read-only as drafter source; Role 2 deploys project-local per S9 decision)
- `INVARIANTS.md` (no new invariants unless something forces it; flag at the time)
- `CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/*`
- `main` branch (commits to `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` only)

NOT doing:
- Roster A (/review-pr) rotation — deferred to Role 2 Session B per kickoff brief §9
- Role 2 Session B (`/upgrade-agent` deployment of health-implementer) — separate session after Pass-2 finalizes
- Roles 3 + 4 Pass-2 (S11 + S12)
- Pass-3 specialist deep-research
- Phase C peptide library campaign
- F-A01 design-doc residual "7-class" prose fix at `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` (deferred bead)
- Token-budget characterization ADR (deferred follow-up)
- CLAUDE.md `.claude/agents/` section addition (deferred follow-up)
- Hook v2.5 punch-list (both edge-case classes at recurrence_count=2)
- INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION promotion (PROPOSED in Role 1 §16; requires change-discipline ritual at review cycle)
- Walter pending items (23andMe, Oura, meal-template, Jan 2026 issue)
- Vault git-tracking decision
- LM-04 first HTML artifact

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — drafter dispatches must inline full 11-section profile; `enforce-role-inlining.sh` PreToolUse hook is the mechanical defense; project-local profile path (`.claude/agents/health-specialist-architect/agent.md`) may exercise the path-pattern edge case (recurrence_count=2)
- PF-S3-01 / AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST — Phase 4 falsification window (third consecutive guard test if held; recurrence_count=2)
- AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION — Phase 5 disposition application across 18 sections + Appendix A; §7 self-attest 17-item checklist is the explicit defense
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — satisfied by this block; `scope-contract-audit.sh --session 10` validates at close
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — canonical form at close
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — rotation rule applied to VOLATILE sections; no SHA prefixes in narrative prose
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — feature branch only; `block-commit-main.sh` is mechanical defense
- INV-RESEARCH-ATTESTATION — N/A (no `aplus-research` dispatch this session)

## Scope Contract — Session 11 (2026-05-27)

Goal: Run design-doc-protocol Phases 1-5 for Role 3 (health-edge-case-reviewer) against `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`. Produce `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` with Status: Final. Third end-to-end exercise of the canonical template (Role 1 S8, Role 2 S10).

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] AC0 — Roster B status verified: architect drafter = project-local health-specialist-architect (rotation active since S10); SE+QA stay v1-substitute (S11 is the LAST cycle running v1-substitute QA). AQ-001 deferred via Option A (Role 3 design doc surfaces what audit needs, not the reverse) — confirmed S11 open.
- [ ] AC1 — Phase 1: 3 parallel drafter dispatches inlining full 11-section profiles verbatim per INV-ROLE-INLINING. Drafts at `design/.health-edge-case-reviewer-design-work/{architect,se,qa}-draft.md`. Each dispatch recorded in `dispatch-ledger.jsonl`.
- [ ] AC2 — Phase 2: orchestrator synthesizes `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` per template (18 sections + Appendix A); §4 INBOUND inherits 8 rows from Role 1 §4 + 5 rows from Role 2 §4.2 by anchor (no content duplication); body↔bibliography symmetry check passes pre-Phase 3.
- [ ] AC3 — Phase 3: 2 red-team dispatches (`/adversarial-review` skill + medical-safety v1-substitute per CONTINUATION_BRIEF §7); findings at `design/.health-edge-case-reviewer-design-work/red-team-{adversarial,safety}.md`.
- [ ] AC4 — Phase 4: PF-S3-01 guard held — every finding personally source-read against cited file before verdict; classifications at `design/.health-edge-case-reviewer-design-work/finding-classifications.md` with verdicts LEGITIMATE / LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED / REJECTED + cited evidence on every REJECTED row.
- [ ] AC5 — Phase 5: LEGITIMATE + LEGITIMATE-MODIFIED dispositions applied; Appendix A populated; §7 self-attest 17/17 binary checklist run; frontmatter `status: Final`; `vault/meta/index.md` + `log.md` appended.
- [ ] AC6 — Close: all 3 audit scripts exit 0 at `--session 11`; PF attestation canonical form `S11 close (YYYY-MM-DD):`; VOLATILE rotation 6-clause; commit + push to feature branch; SESSION_KICKOFF.md flipped to `status: consumed`.

- `vault/meta/log.md` (append create op)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if new PF surfaces)
- `.beads/*` via `bd` CLI

Files I will NOT touch:
- `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` (Final, read-only — defects → bead)
- `design/health-implementer-design.md` (Final, read-only — defects → bead)
- `design/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md` (canonical, read-only)

NOT doing:
- Working any S10-sourced bead unless on Role 3 critical path (AQ-001 `h1z` deferred via Option A)
- Role 2 Session B (`/upgrade-agent` against Role 2 design — separate session)
- Role 4 Pass-2 design (S12)
- Pass-3 specialist deep-research (S13)
- Phase C peptide library campaign
- Template / INVARIANTS / CLAUDE modifications
- Roster A (/review-pr) rotation (`9yk`)
- Audit-script bash (`3y6`)
- Hook v2.5 punch-list (`hca`)
- Walter pending items (23andMe, Oura, meal-template, Jan-2026 issue)
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)
- Vault git-tracking decision
- INV-HARM-CLASS-COMPOSITION promotion (PROPOSED; requires change-discipline ritual)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — 3 drafter + 2 red-team dispatches; `enforce-role-inlining.sh` PreToolUse hook is mechanical guard; project-local architect path may again exercise path-pattern edge case (recurrence_count=2; bead `hca`)
- AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST / PF-S3-01 (recurrence_count=2) — Phase 4 is the fifth consecutive falsification window (S7/S8/S9/S10 held)
- AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION — §4 INBOUND inherits from BOTH Role 1 (8 rows) AND Role 2 (5 rows); 13 anchor citations to keep faithful; §7 self-attest 17-item checklist is explicit defense
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — satisfied by this block; `scope-contract-audit.sh --session 11` validates at close
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — canonical form at close
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — rotation rule applied to VOLATILE sections at close; no SHA prefixes in narrative
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — feature branch only; `block-commit-main.sh` is mechanical defense
- INV-RESEARCH-ATTESTATION — N/A (no `aplus-research` dispatch this session)

Self-recognition pre-flight: Watching specifically at Phase 4 for "I already verified findings like these on Roles 1 and 2, the pattern is familiar" — pattern familiarity is not a substitute for source-reading. Watching at Phase 2 for the "Phase-2-synthesis-omission" pattern (S10 observation, recurrence_count=1) — running `grep -c '^## '` on the synthesized doc PRE-Phase-3 instead of letting red-team catch it.
