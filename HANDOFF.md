# Session Handoff

## Scope Contract — Session 5

Goal: Build project-suited drafting-team foundation (4 new roles) and 3 pilot specialist design docs (7 total) via Quant design-doc-protocol. Sequential across roles, parallel within. Probable multi-session work; checkpoint after each role. Defer `/upgrade-agent` runs and agent.md authoring to Session B.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] `design/` folder created with Quant-style README naming the 7-role pipeline
- [ ] Role 1 health-specialist-architect: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/health-specialist-architect-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 2 health-implementer: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/health-implementer-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 3 health-edge-case-reviewer: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/health-edge-case-reviewer-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 4 medical-safety-reviewer: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/medical-safety-reviewer-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Checkpoint pause after roles 1-4 for user authorization before specialist roles
- [ ] Role 5 labs-specialist: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; uses new foundation drafters; `design/labs-specialist-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 6 peptide-specialist: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/peptide-specialist-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Role 7 medical-liaison: 5-phase design-doc-protocol complete; `design/medical-liaison-design.md` Status: Final
- [ ] Every dispatched agent prompt pastes the full 11-section role profile verbatim per INV-ROLE-INLINING
- [ ] No orchestrator self-attestation of red-team verdicts (PF-S3-01 guard); each finding personally verified against cited source
- [ ] HANDOFF rotation rule applied to VOLATILE sections at each checkpoint commit
- [ ] PF attestation appended at close in canonical form `S5 close (YYYY-MM-DD): ...`
- [ ] All three audit scripts (handoff-audit, scope-contract-audit, pf-attestation-audit) exit 0 at close
- [ ] All commits land on feature branch, none on main

Files I WILL touch:
- `design/` (new) + `design/README.md`
- `design/{role}-design.md` × 7
- `design/.{role}-design-work/*` × 7 (drafts, red-team, OQ-list, domain-research)
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + per-checkpoint progress + close)
- `vault/sessions/session-5.md` (close note)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if a new PF surfaces)
- `.beads/*` (via `bd` CLI only)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `vault/library/*`, `vault/compounds/*`, `vault/biomarkers/*`, `vault/dna/*`, `vault/labs/*`
- `.claude/skills/*` (including aplus-research and deep-research)
- `.claude/commands/*` (including upgrade-agent)
- `.claude/agents/` (deferred to Session B — design docs only this session)
- `~/Documents/Projects/skills_library/roles/*` (no role profiles deployed; design docs inform Session B authoring)
- `INVARIANTS.md` (no new invariants this session)
- `scripts/` (owned by the parallel session)
- `CLAUDE.md` (owned by the parallel session this cycle)
- `~/.claude/*` (global config untouched)
- `main` branch (commits to `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` only)

NOT doing:
- Running `/upgrade-agent` against any design doc (Session B)
- Writing any `agent.md` profile (Session B)
- The 11 remaining specialists (only pilot 3 + 4 foundation)
- Tiered vs per-agent design decision (explicit post-pilot review)
- Vault git-tracking decision
- LM-04 first HTML artifact generation
- S4 mechanical-enforcement TODO audit scripts (other session)
- Bug-001 follow-up / aplus-research v2 calibration

Invariants at risk:
- INV-ROLE-INLINING — every agent dispatch inlines full 11-section profile verbatim; `enforce-role-inlining.sh` PreToolUse hook is the mechanical check
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — satisfied by this block; `scope-contract-audit.sh` validates format at close
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — currently on `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research`; discipline-only guard until pre-commit hook lands
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — canonical form at close
- INV-HO-ROTATION / INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — rotation rule applied to VOLATILE sections; no SHA prefixes in narrative prose
- INV-RESEARCH-ATTESTATION — N/A (no `aplus-research` dispatch this session); `/deep-research` paired-judge rigor is the substitute and is NOT self-attested

## Session 4 close — 2026-05-25

Two cycles this session: (a) the user caught and challenged orchestrator self-attestation of 5 of 6 aplus-research gates (PF-S3-01, recurrence_count=2 of the PF-S2-01 class); (b) rigor-framework adoption + mechanical resistance built and the BPC-157 entry re-verified clean through path-(b) re-dispatches. Commit `8b05b30`. The attestation_chain is now intact across all 6 gates with sha256 of each agent-written source.

**Historical (kept for reference):** Session 3 BPC-157 rebuild context lives in `vault/sessions/session-3.md` (the entry-rebuild itself was at commit `7a98c72`, 2026-05-24).

## Recovery After Compaction

If context was compacted, run `bd prime` then:
1. Read this file (HANDOFF.md)
2. Read `vault/meta/overview.md` (system state summary + knowledge-layer map)
3. Read `vault/meta/contradictions.md` if it exists
4. Read MEMORY.md (in `~/.claude/projects/-Users-waltermcgivney-Documents-Projects-a-plus-maxing/memory/`)
5. Read `vault/WIKI.md` (wiki schema + agent consumer roster)
6. Query vault for current phase (basic-memory search)
7. Read the most recent session note in `vault/sessions/` — currently `session-2.md`
8. Read `vault/decisions/` for architecture decisions
9. Read `.claude/skills/aplus-research/SKILL.md` (project-local research skill with blocking gates — the path to use for all wiki-bound research from session 3 forward)
10. Read `vault/design/artifact-design-protocol.md` before generating any HTML artifact

## What Changed (Session 3, 2026-05-24)

### `aplus-research` skill development (pre-restart)
- `--update[=<reason-slug>]` flag implemented. Phase 2.75 archive-before-write; default slug `rerotation`; pattern enforced. SKILL.md, gate-2.75.schema.json (+ `update_mode`, `update_reason_slug`, `archive_paths`, 3 new halt reasons, conditional invariant), commands/aplus-research.md updated. 8/8 schema smoke-test cases pass.

### BPC-157 canonical rebuild — first end-to-end run of `aplus-research`
- Invoked `/aplus-research "Build canonical library entry for BPC-157" --mode=deep --target=peptide/bpc-157 --update=suspect-fabrications`.
- **All 6 blocking gates PASS, schema-validated.** Gate sequence: 2.75 SCOPE (archived 4 prior artifacts) → 3.5 JUDGE (6 paired retrieval+judge dispatches; 3 sections needed iter-2 remediation; final scores 100/100/100/99/99/100) → 4.75 INTEGRITY (7 IC-10 metadata fixes applied across 4 sections; IC-13 corpus scoping 30/30 probes PASS, **zero fabricated claims detected**) → 6 CRITIQUE (15 findings: 1 critical citation-crosswalk + 9 major + 5 minor; all addressed in Phase 7 refine) → 7.5 RISK-FLOOR (risk_tier=experimental, 8 third-party monitoring markers named, contraindications + monitoring + stopping criteria all populated) → 8.5 LAYERS (practitioner-layer + non-english-layer both written with bibliography + self-check).
- **Canonical fabrication catch:** S2 dispatch attributed He L 2022 (*Front Pharmacol* 13:1026182) as a human PK study. Independent verification via PMC9794587 (Section D + Section E + IC-13 grep) confirmed: rats (n=324) + beagle dogs (n=6), **no human subjects**. There is no published human PK paper for BPC-157. This is the load-bearing correction that justified the rebuild.
- **6 additional bibliographic corrections** logged to `vault/meta/contradictions.md` as C1–C7 (Xu 2020 institution → Fourth Military Medical Univ Xi'an, not PLA Beijing; Sikirić 1993 PMID 8298609 not 8298605; McGuire FP not Bemis-Standoli as first author of *Curr Rev Musculoskelet Med* 2025; Lee & Burgess 2025 co-author Burgess K not C; FDA 503A Cat 2 removed April 22 2026 via nominations withdrawal NOT safety clearance; Xue 2004 → Fourth Military Medical Univ Xi'an = secondary concentration finding placing 3 papers in single Xi'an cluster; Klicek R/Sever M author order on PMID 24304574).
- **Concentration audit:** 52 deduplicated primaries; 75.0% Sikirić-Zagreb academic share; 80.8% combined Zagreb metro (incl. Pliva industrial). Far above 70% threshold. Mandatory first-class concentration section surfaced in synthesis §2 before any indication subsection. Largest non-Sikirić cluster = Chang Gung Taiwan (4); secondary independent finding: Xi'an Fourth Military Medical Univ has 3 papers (single-institution cluster on the "independent Chinese signal").
- **Honest absences surfaced:** no independent in-vivo MSK replication exists outside Sikirić cluster; no human PK paper exists in any language; no chronic >6-week GLP package; no Phase 3 RCT; only 2 registered interventional human trials worldwide (none with results posted); Edwin Lee single-investigator/single-clinic = 100% of post-2003 US human evidence; PL 14736 UC Phase 2 (Ruenzi 2005) was conducted but **never published as full paper** — only Gastroenterology conference abstract.
- **Synthesis size:** 20,635 words pre-refinement; 1,039 lines / ~22K words post-refinement (deep-mode floor 10K). All inline citations renumbered to bibliography 1–52 crosswalk.
- **Skill maturity:** the `aplus-research` skill worked. Phase 4.75 IC-13 corpus scoping is the gate that caught the He L 2022 species misattribution and the 7 bibliographic metadata mismatches. The gate spec held under real use. v1 limitations noted: judge agents returned divergent JSON shapes (workaround: orchestrator hardcoded scores into gate-3.5.json from agent reports); per-citation HEAD-checking budget (IC-10) was best-effort against fetch failures.

## What Changed (Session 2, 2026-05-23)
- Karpathy-style wiki schema added at `vault/WIKI.md` with 14-agent consumer roster (personal-trainer, labs-specialist, nutritionist, supplement-specialist, peptide-specialist, endocrine-specialist, lymphatic-specialist, gi-specialist, cardiovascular-specialist, sleep-coach, recovery-specialist, longevity-strategist, mental-performance-coach, medical-liaison)
- Meta files added: `operator-profile.md`, `current-state.md`, `goals.md`, `contradictions.md`, `index.md`, `log.md` — together form the agent-shared context layer
- Source whitelist at `vault/library/_source-whitelist.md` — 5 standard tiers plus Tier 2.7 (practitioner_protocol) plus Tier NE (non-English literature) plus 12-tag type enum plus admissibility matrix
- Entity templates: `compounds/_template.md`, `biomarkers/_template.md` — each compound template now mandates Non-English Literature Coverage + Prescribing-Practice Layer sections
- First compound library entry: BPC-157 at `vault/library/peptides/bpc-157/{research-report,practitioner-layer,non-english-layer}.md` + `vault/compounds/bpc-157.md`. Entry is structurally complete but the user has flagged that the original deep-research dispatch did not follow protocol and the entry is suspected to contain hallucinations / fabrications / false citations. Re-run scheduled for next session.
- One contradiction logged and resolved same-session: He L 2022 PK paper author attribution (was incorrectly "Xu et al." in original dispatch)
- `aplus-research` project-local skill built at `.claude/skills/aplus-research/` with SKILL.md + 2 reference files + 6 JSON schemas + slash command at `.claude/commands/aplus-research.md`. Six blocking gates: 2.75 SCOPE, 3.5 JUDGE, 4.75 INTEGRITY (incl IC-13 per-citation corpus scoping), 6 CRITIQUE (deep+), 7.5 RISK-FLOOR (compounds), 8.5 LAYERS (standard+ compounds). Three health-specific gates not in deep-research: population-mismatch, risk-floor, concentration-audit. Schema invariants smoke-tested — 6 representative bad payloads all rejected.
- Session protocol violation tracked in `memory/process-failures.md` PF-S2-01 through PF-S2-04

## What Did NOT Work (Do Not Retry)
See `memory/process-failures.md`. Six entries this session: PF-S2-01 (declared deep mode but skipped paired judges + critique + refine), PF-S2-02 (author attribution error caught by accident, not verification), PF-S2-03 (over-questioning user during scoping), PF-S2-04 (over-personalized library research before correction), PF-S2-05 (session close protocol partial execution — multiple required steps skipped or wrongly executed), PF-S2-06 (branch hygiene — all S2 commits landed on main instead of feature branch).

## Drift Checks (S2 close)

### Task drift
Scope expanded user-directed at every step. Started: "is the LLM wiki set up?" Ended: wiki schema + first compound entry + the wrapper skill that should have produced that entry. No silent scope drift; every expansion was explicit user direction.

### Architecture drift
No `INVARIANTS.md` exists for this project yet. CLAUDE.md's Cross-Document Ownership Matrix + rotation rule are the de facto invariants. Architecture drift CHECK result: VIOLATION — phase-state facts initially went into HANDOFF's "What Changed" section instead of `vault/meta/overview.md` (Matrix explicitly forbids this). Caught and corrected in the same close cycle; overview.md updated. Rotation rule clause 3 (no SHA prefixes in prose) was also violated then corrected. No invariant is in worse shape after S2 than before, but the close cycle itself produced two violations that were caught only after user challenge.

### Vision drift
System after S2 IS: LLM-driven personal health agent with a queryable knowledge base (wiki schema + agent roster + source whitelist), one suspect compound entry pending re-run, and a mechanically-gated research wrapper skill. Vision per S1: "LLM-driven personal health agent, markdown + HTML hybrid, A→B→C phased build, evidence-driven." Same project. No vision drift.

## Top-3 active failure modes (VOLATILE — rotates each session)

Forward-facing readiness for next session. Replaced at every close, not accumulated. Per Rigor Framework Discipline 8.

1. **AP-ORCH-SELF-ATTEST** (PF-S2-01 + PF-S3-01, recurrence_count=2) — mechanical defenses (`gate_attest.py` attestation_chain + inlining hook) are live since S4 but **still untested in a fresh aplus-research dispatch**. The first peptide library campaign run (Phase C) is the next falsification window. If gate-self-attestation slips past the new defenses → recurrence_count=3 → mandatory structural fix (likely UUIDv4 agent-identity ledger replacing brief-hash uniqueness).
2. **AP-INCOMPLETE-PROPAGATION** (S4 finding) — metadata fixes land in obvious places but miss adjacent narrative/tally/self-check sections holding the same value. v2 mitigation embedded in SKILL.md (S6 AC2: post-fix grep block injected into every remediation brief) but untested in production. First Phase 4.25/4.75 remediation cycle in the peptide campaign is the falsification window.
3. **AP-ACT-BEFORE-VERIFY** (PF-S6-01, new this cycle) — acting on HANDOFF-described state without verifying the state still matches. Caught by user mid-S6 ("what procedure did you use"). Mitigation: `feedback_beads_cleanup_procedure.md` memory; recurrence guard documented. Watch for any "fix the state HANDOFF described" task in future sessions — verify first.

## Current State (volatile)
- **BPC-157 canonical library entry** live with clean attestation_chain across all 6 gates. Per-section judge scores (iter-4 final, path-b re-dispatch): A=100, B=100, C=100, D=99, E=99, F=100.
- **Mechanical-enforcement infrastructure complete** (S5a): 3 audit scripts (`handoff-audit.sh`, `scope-contract-audit.sh`, `pf-attestation-audit.sh`) + `audit-helpers.sh` shared lib + `block-commit-main.sh` PreToolUse hook. Wired into CLAUDE.md close step 8.5. 73/73 audit-side tests pass. 5 invariants promoted from TODO to live: INV-HO-ROTATION, INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH, INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN.
- **aplus-research v2 calibration complete** (S6): Phase 4.25 ID-Reconcile gate inserted as BLOCKING for standard+; post-fix grep brief addendum; judge JSON skeleton; archive permalink policy. New schema `gate-4.25.schema.json` + 4 new gate_attest tests (T13-T16). INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID registered. 16/16 gate_attest tests pass.
- **Design/Pass 1 complete** (parallel S5 cycle): 4 foundation-role Phase 0 deep-research deliverables for the 14-specialist roster build (health-specialist-architect, health-implementer, health-edge-case-reviewer, medical-safety-reviewer). ~49,500 words total. All cleared 99/100 rubric across iter cycles. Brief at `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md` packages everything for Pass 2 + Pass 3.
- **INVARIANTS register at 12 entries** (was 8 at S4 close). 4 invariants still rely on manual discipline; remaining gaps documented in INVARIANTS.md §"Pending mechanical-enforcement gaps."
- **Active landmarks** unchanged: LM-01 doctor visit (July 2026), LM-02 Oura, LM-03 23andMe, LM-04 first HTML artifact. No trigger windows open today.
- **Branch:** `feature/wiki-bpc157-aplus-research` at commit `d6c992a` as of 2026-05-26 S5/S6 joint close. `main` also at `d6c992a`. Both pushed to `origin` (github.com/lvl0lvl/a-plus-maxing) after remote-rebuild bootstrap on 2026-05-26.

**Historical (kept for reference):** prior-cycle state lives in `vault/sessions/session-4.md`; design/Pass 1 detail in `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md`.

## What Is Next (volatile)

### Phase C — Peptide library campaign (highest leverage; aplus-research v2 falsification window)
The aplus-research skill is now calibrated against its own documented failure modes (S3/S4/S5/S6). The first new `/aplus-research` run since the v2 calibration is the falsification window for Top-3 items 1 + 2. Each peptide run is its own session by default (long-running, per-peptide close-protocol audits matter). Triage queue lives at `vault/library/peptides/_triage.md`.

### Design Pass 2 — foundation role design docs (per `design/CONTINUATION_BRIEF.md` §6 option A)
Sequential per role 1→4 via design-doc-protocol Phase 1-5. Requires no new infrastructure; reuses inlining hook + existing audit scripts. User authorization needed before kickoff (per Pass 1 checkpoint).

### Design Pass 3 — pilot specialists (labs-specialist, peptide-specialist, medical-liaison)
Runs after Pass 2 completes. Peptide-specialist is on the LM-01 (July 2026 doctor visit) critical path.

### Candidate audit-script extensions (from design/Pass 1 §9 candidate invariants)
- `INV-DESIGN-DOC-SYMMETRY` + `scripts/design-doc-audit.sh` — body↔bibliography symmetry; ~50-line bash; defer until Pass 2 emits its first `design/{role}-design.md`
- Pattern-label consistency check (synthesis P-labels ⊆ Phase-4 verifier P-catalog)
- Deep-research deliverable floors (word count, source count, no-placeholder)
- Fabrication-shaped URL scan
None promoted yet; require user authorization + INVARIANTS change-discipline ritual.

### v2.5 punch-list (small)
- `agent-verdict-halt` sentinel inconsistency — `gate_attest.py` fallback string not in any gate schema's `halt_reasons` enum; orchestrator workaround documented as Open Issue. Either extend enums or change fallback.
- Comment in `enforce-role-inlining.sh` noting the path-obfuscation edge case is known + intentional (per design/Pass 1 Q1 disclosure).

### Open project work (unchanged)
- Walter pending: 23andMe raw file to `vault/dna/raw/`; Oura purchase; meal-template content; January 2026 health issue characterization. `medium+` risk-tier HALT remains active on BPC-157 movement from `researching` to `planned` until populated.
- Vault git-tracking decision still deferred.
- First HTML artifact generation still deferred (LM-04 active landmark).

## Landmark window check (close step 8.7)

All 4 active landmarks (LM-01 doctor visit, LM-02 Oura, LM-03 23andMe, LM-04 first HTML artifact) — no trigger windows opened during S4. LM-01 trigger window opens ~14 days before the July 2026 visit date; the scoped audit dispatch is queued for that date.

## Open Issues

### Vault not in git (unchanged from S1)
Per S1 HANDOFF. Decision still deferred. Note: all S2+ vault content has been committed (per user instruction) but the underlying `.gitignore` policy was not reconsidered.

### `agent-verdict-halt` sentinel inconsistency (gate_attest.py vs schemas)
S6 observation: when an agent emits `verdict: HALT` and the orchestrator's scaffold has empty `halt_reasons`, `gate_attest.py attest` injects `"agent-verdict-halt"` as a fallback. That string is not in any gate schema's `halt_reasons` enum, so schema validation fails. Workaround: orchestrator must pre-populate `halt_reasons` with a valid enum value in the scaffold before attest. Either (a) extend every gate schema's halt_reasons enum to include `agent-verdict-halt`, or (b) change the script's fallback to be phase-aware. Defer to v2.5 cleanup.

## Scope Contract — Session 5 (2026-05-25)

Goal: Build the 4 mechanical-enforcement audit scripts + shared helpers library + pre-commit branch-block hook, wired into the close protocol and reflected in INVARIANTS.md.

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] `scripts/lib/audit-helpers.sh` — shared `emit` / `fail` / violations-counter (per Rigor Framework Discipline 5 §3); 16/16 smoke tests pass
- [x] `scripts/handoff-audit.sh` — checks INV-HO-ROTATION (clauses 2 + 5) + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH; 12/12 smoke tests pass; exits 0 on current HANDOFF.md
- [x] `scripts/scope-contract-audit.sh` — checks HANDOFF.md carries a `## Scope Contract — Session N` block with required subfields and binary ACs; 12/12 smoke tests pass
- [x] `scripts/pf-attestation-audit.sh` — checks canonical `S<N> close (YYYY-MM-DD):` attestation line; 12/12 smoke tests pass
- [x] `.claude/hooks/block-commit-main.sh` — PreToolUse Bash hook blocking `git commit` while HEAD = main; wired into `.claude/settings.json`; 21/21 smoke tests pass
- [x] Smoke tests for each remaining script — all pass (73/73 across 5 suites)
- [x] `INVARIANTS.md` Mechanical Verification column updated for INV-HO-ROTATION, INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN, INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION — TODO markers removed; S5 Change Log row added
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` close protocol step 8.5 expanded to invoke the 3 new audit scripts (handoff, scope-contract, pf-attestation)

Files I WILL touch:
- `scripts/lib/audit-helpers.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/handoff-audit.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/scope-contract-audit.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/pf-attestation-audit.sh` (NEW)
- `scripts/tests/` (NEW, smoke fixtures + runner)
- `.claude/hooks/block-commit-main.sh` (NEW)
- `.claude/hooks/tests/test_block_commit_main.sh` (NEW)
- `.claude/settings.json` (add PreToolUse Bash matcher)
- `INVARIANTS.md` (Mechanical Verification cells + Change Log row)
- `CLAUDE.md` (close-protocol step 8.5)
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + at session close)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `vault/library/peptides/bpc-157/*` and `vault/compounds/bpc-157.md`
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/*`
- `vault/meta/landmarks.md`
- Any agent role profile files (separate session per user direction)

NOT doing:
- Specialist role profiles (peptide-specialist, medical-liaison) — separate session
- v2 aplus-research calibration findings
- Vault git-tracking decision
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)
- Beads ticket dep-cleanup
- Walter pending items (23andMe, Oura, meal-template, Jan-2026 issue)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH — audited by this session's own deliverable (built-in falsification)
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT — this contract satisfies it
- INV-PF-ATTESTATION — mandatory at close
- INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — already on feature branch; new hook becomes second line of defense

## Session 5 close — audit-scripts cycle (2026-05-25)

Audit-script foundation built and wired. All 8 ACs PASS. 73/73 tests pass across 5 suites. Five INVARIANTS-register entries promoted from TODO-mechanical-verification to live scripts/hooks. CLAUDE.md close-protocol step 8.5 now invokes all three audit scripts.

This is one of two parallel S5 cycles. The other cycle (drafting-team foundation + 7 specialist design docs) is mid-flight with its own Scope Contract above. VOLATILE section rotation is deferred to whichever cycle closes last so that Top-3 / Current State / What Is Next reflect both cycles.

**Drift checks:**
- **Task drift:** Scope expanded once mid-session — appended the S5 Scope Contract after the audit-helpers AC completed (I omitted step 7 at session start). Caught and corrected; no other drift. Audit-surfaced fix to HANDOFF line 90 (bare SHA) was an explicit one-off per feedback memory; not a workflow.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. Five invariants strengthened by mechanical-enforcement uplift. New audit scripts respect the Cross-Document Ownership Matrix (each script has a single invariant ID it owns).
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S5a IS the same LLM-driven personal health agent with mechanically-enforced session-lifecycle invariants now joining the mechanically-enforced research-domain invariants. Rigor compounds.

**PF attestation:**

S5 close (2026-05-25): No new PF-class entries this session. The HANDOFF line-90 bare-SHA defect surfaced by the audit was a residual S4-close miss (not a new failure mode); fixed in-session as a one-off scope expansion that the audit's own AC required. The mid-session scope-contract-omission (failure to append the contract at step 7) is logged here as an observation; if it recurs N=2 it promotes to PF.

## Scope Contract — Session 6 (2026-05-25)

Goal: Apply 4 v2 calibration findings to the aplus-research skill in place, with smoke tests where mechanically verifiable. Skill remains usable for the upcoming peptide library campaign.

Acceptance criteria:
- [x] AC1 — Phase 4.25 ID-Reconcile inserted as BLOCKING gate for standard+; full spec in SKILL.md; `schemas/gate-4.25.schema.json` validated; gate_attest.py wired (ATTESTED_GATES + SOURCE_MD); INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID added to INVARIANTS register
- [x] AC2 — Post-fix grep enforcement: dedicated "Remediation brief addendum" section in SKILL.md with verbatim block orchestrator injects into Phase 3.5 iter-2+, 4.25 iter-2+, 4.75 verifier remediation, Phase 6 critique remediation
- [x] AC3 — Phase 3 judge brief now embeds literal JSON skeleton (9 dimensions + total + threshold + verdict + findings array) with structural rules
- [x] AC4 — Archive permalink policy documented in Phase 8 §3: scoped under `a-plus-maxing/compounds/_archive/<slug>-<date>-<reason-slug>`; orchestrator rewrites permalink BEFORE archive move in Phase 2.75
- [x] AC5 — Calibration history table near top of SKILL.md (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2 ACs)
- [x] AC6 — Smoke verification: gate_attest 16/16 pass (12 existing + 4 new for phase 4.25 round-trip incl. PASS + HALT + override + stale-source); all audit-script suites still green
- [x] AC7 — Close-protocol audits all exit 0; PF attestation in canonical form (below)

Files I WILL touch:
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/references/citation-integrity.md` (if needed)
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/schemas/gate-3.5.schema.json` (if AC3 requires)
- `.claude/skills/aplus-research/schemas/gate-4.75.schema.json` (if AC1 affects)
- New `.claude/skills/aplus-research/schemas/gate-4.25.schema.json` (only if AC1 = blocking gate)
- New fixture/smoke test under `.claude/skills/aplus-research/tests/`
- `HANDOFF.md` (this contract + close note)
- `memory/process-failures.md` (only if new PF surfaces)

Files I will NOT touch:
- `vault/library/peptides/bpc-157/*`, `vault/compounds/bpc-157.md`
- `vault/library/peptides/_triage.md`
- `scripts/*`, `.claude/hooks/*`
- `design/*`
- `INVARIANTS.md` (unless AC1 introduces a new INV; flag at the time)
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `~/.claude/skills/deep-research/*`

NOT doing:
- Peptide library campaign runs (Phase C; separate sessions)
- Beads dep cleanup (deferred or rolled into close if quick)
- Specialist role profiles (parallel session)
- Walter pending items
- Vault git-tracking decision
- First HTML artifact (LM-04)

Invariants at risk:
- INV-RESEARCH-ATTESTATION (gate-3.5 schema touches must preserve attestation_chain)
- INV-RESEARCH-IC13-CORPUS (remediation grep must stay distinct from IC-13 verifier)
- INV-HO-ROTATION + INV-HO-NO-STALE-HASH (rotation deferred to last-closing S5/S6 cycle)
- INV-SCOPE-CONTRACT, INV-PF-ATTESTATION, INV-BRANCH-NOT-MAIN — standard close discipline

## Session 6 close — v2 aplus-research calibration (2026-05-25)

All 7 ACs PASS. 4 calibration findings applied in place to the existing skill (no fork). One new invariant registered: INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID. New schema `schemas/gate-4.25.schema.json` + 4 new gate_attest smoke tests (T13-T16). Existing 12 tests still pass.

**Skill changes:**
- Pipeline overview + mode tables + gate-by-mode matrix updated for Phase 4.25
- New Phase 4.25 ID-Reconcile spec (5 entity classes: citations, institutions, compound IDs, regulatory dates, trial registrations)
- New "Remediation brief addendum" section with verbatim post-fix-grep block
- Phase 3 judge brief includes literal JSON skeleton (9 dimensions, 2 structural rules)
- Phase 8 §3 archive permalink policy (scoped under `_archive/<slug>-<date>-<reason-slug>`)
- New Calibration history table near top (v1.0 → v1.1 → v2 ACs)
- Schema files table updated
- `lib/gate_attest.py`: phase 4.25 added to ATTESTED_GATES + SOURCE_MD map

**Tests:** 16/16 gate_attest, 89/89 across all audit + hook + gate suites combined.

**Drift checks:**
- **Task drift:** AC1 introduced a new invariant (INV-RESEARCH-CROSS-SECTION-ID) which was flagged in the original scope contract ("unless AC1 introduces a new INV; flag at the time"). Not silent drift. Otherwise scope held exactly.
- **Architecture drift:** No invariant degraded. INVARIANTS register gained one mechanically-enforced research-domain invariant. CLAUDE.md Cross-Document Ownership Matrix respected — SKILL.md owns the skill spec, INVARIANTS.md owns the invariants register, schema files own gate verdict structure.
- **Vision drift:** Same project. System after S6 has the aplus-research skill calibrated against the specific failure modes that S3/S4 BPC-157 surfaced. Skill is now ready for the peptide library campaign (Phase C, separate sessions).

**PF attestation:**

S6 close (2026-05-25): One new PF entry promoted (PF-S6-01, AP-ACT-BEFORE-VERIFY) caught by user mid-session: started a "beads cleanup" task without verifying current state or having a documented procedure; HANDOFF entry was stale and the issue had been resolved in S3/S4. User's "what procedure did you use" forced the honest answer. Logged in `memory/process-failures.md` with recurrence_count=1; feedback memory `feedback_beads_cleanup_procedure.md` saved with verify-first procedure. No PF-S2-01 or PF-S3-01 class recurrences observed. The Phase 4.25 schema mismatch I hit mid-session (top-level `iterations` required vs attest_simple not auto-populating it) was a latent gap in the documented scaffold pattern — not a PF; documented inline via T13-T16 tests. The `agent-verdict-halt` sentinel inconsistency observed during T15 debugging is pre-existing; recorded as an Open Issue for v2.5 cleanup.
